# Strategic NDA Chatbox Improvements Summary

## 1. Section Number Awareness ✓
- AI now references exact section numbers in all responses
- Section mapping adjusts dynamically based on pseudonym usage
- Form field changes are mapped to affected sections

## 2. Context Persistence Fix ✓  
- Essential fields (term, state, parties) always sent with requests
- No more "duration not specified" errors on follow-up questions
- Maintains conversation context throughout session

## 3. Dynamic Quick Actions ✓
- Section numbers adjust correctly based on pseudonym setting

- Popular, practical questions users actually want answered

## Current Quick Actions:
1. What exactly counts as confidential? (scope)
2. Is [X years] too long? (duration)
3. Can I tell my lawyer/accountant? (exceptions)
4. What happens if someone breaches? (remedies)
5. When can I destroy their info? (obligations)

## How Section Numbers Work:

**Without Pseudonyms:**
- Section 1: Confidential Information
- Section 2: Exclusions
- Section 3: Obligations
- Section 4: Permitted Disclosures
- Section 5: Term
- Section 6: Remedies

**With Pseudonyms:**
- Section 1: Identity of Parties (NEW)
- Sections 2-7: All shifted up by 1
- Exhibit A: Side Letter

## Testing Quick Reference:
1. Toggle "Use pseudonyms" checkbox
2. Watch quick actions update section numbers
3. Ask about any section - AI will use correct number
