# Testing the Context Persistence Fix

## Quick Test Steps

1. **Set your NDA details**:
   - Duration: 5 Years
   - State: California
   - Purpose: JHGJHGJHGKH (or any test text)
   - Monetary Consideration: Checked with amount 4654365463

2. **First Question**: Ask any general question like:
   - "What is this NDA for?"
   - "Explain the key sections"

3. **Follow-up Question**: Ask specifically about duration:
   - "How long will it last?"
   - "What's the term?"
   - "When does this expire?"

## Expected Behavior

**Before Fix**: 
- Response: "Section 5: Term addresses the duration of the Strategic NDA. Since the duration is not specified in the current context..."

**After Fix**:
- Response: "Section 5: Term establishes that your Strategic NDA will remain in effect for 5 years. This 5-year duration applies both to the agreement itself and to the survival of confidentiality obligations after termination..."

## Why This Matters

The chatbox needs to maintain context about essential agreement terms throughout the conversation to provide accurate, helpful responses. Users shouldn't have to re-enter information they've already provided in the form.
