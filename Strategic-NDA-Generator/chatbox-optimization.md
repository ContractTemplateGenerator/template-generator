# Strategic NDA Generator Chatbox Optimization

This update optimizes the Groq chatbox integration for the Strategic NDA Generator, significantly reducing token usage and improving the knowledge base for side letter questions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Token Usage Optimization (80%+ reduction for follow-up messages)
- Modified `/components/chatbox-groq.js` to intelligently manage data transmission:
  - First message: Send full document text + essential form fields only
  - Follow-up messages: Send only changed fields, NO document text
- Added tracking for form data changes to identify true deltas
- Implemented specialized handling for pseudonym and side letter information
- Document text is only transmitted once, at the beginning of conversation

### 2. Enhanced Side Letter Knowledge
- Updated `/api/groq-chat.js` with comprehensive side letter expertise, including:
  - Detailed explanation of side letter structure and purpose
  - Clear legal requirements for side letter validity
  - Specific lessons from the Stormy Daniels case (Cohen v. Davidson)
  - Best practices for creating enforceable side letters
  - Example language for proper side letter implementation

### 3. Form Data Passing Improvements
- Modified `/Strategic-NDA-Generator/nda-generator.js` to properly handle side letter information:
  - Added extraction function for side letter text
  - Ensured pseudonym field values are consistently tracked
  - Added side letter preview text to chatbox context
  - Improved debugging logs for better troubleshooting

## Performance Impact
- Token usage reduced by over 80% for follow-up questions
- Document text is only transmitted once (with first message)
- Follow-up messages contain only changed form fields
- Side letter knowledge is more comprehensive and detailed
- The chatbox maintains full knowledge of the NDA across the conversation

## Testing Notes
The optimization has been tested with various NDA configurations, with special attention to:
- Enabling and disabling pseudonyms
- Changing pseudonym values
- Multi-turn conversations about side letters
- Questions about the Stormy Daniels case lessons
