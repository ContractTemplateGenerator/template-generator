# Thailand Cannabis Laws 2025: Comprehensive Research Report

**Last Updated:** December 2025
**Research Date:** December 30, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Thailand's cannabis landscape has undergone dramatic changes since 2022. After becoming the first Asian country to decriminalize cannabis in June 2022, Thailand reversed course in June 2025, re-criminalizing recreational use while maintaining a medical-only framework. The regulatory environment remains fragmented, with pending legislation expected to create a unified cannabis law.

---

## 1. Current Legal Status (Late 2024/2025)

### Key Regulatory Change: June 26, 2025

On June 25, 2025, Public Health Minister Somsak Thepsuthin introduced new regulations classifying the cannabis flower as a **controlled herb** under the Protection and Promotion of Thai Traditional Medicine Knowledge Act B.E. 2542 (1999). These regulations took effect on June 26, 2025.

### Current Classification

- **Cannabis flowers (buds):** Classified as a "controlled herb" - NOT reclassified as a narcotic under the Narcotic Act
- **Recreational cannabis:** ILLEGAL
- **Medical cannabis:** LEGAL with prescription only
- **CBD products (under 0.2% THC):** Legal with restrictions

### What Is Now Prohibited

- Recreational sale of cannabis
- Purchase of cannabis buds without a valid prescription
- Public consumption of cannabis
- Advertising of cannabis products
- Cannabis tourism targeting recreational users

### Legal Activities

- Medical use with a valid prescription from a licensed Thai practitioner
- Cultivation by licensed operators with GACP certification
- Sale by licensed dispensaries to prescription-holders only
- CBD products containing less than 0.2% THC (FDA approved)

   - Pharmacist
   - Dentist

2. Be at least **20 years old**
3. Not be pregnant or breastfeeding
4. Prescription valid for **30 days maximum**

### Can Tourists Get Prescriptions?

**CONFLICTING INFORMATION EXISTS:**

**Sources indicating tourists CAN access:**
- Some clinics in Bangkok, Phuket, Koh Samui, and Chiang Mai offer prescriptions to tourists
- Several private clinics specifically market to foreign visitors

**Sources indicating tourists CANNOT access:**
- Under 2025 regulations, medical cannabis prescriptions may only be available to Thai residents and those with valid long-term visas

- Private consumption only - public use is prohibited

### Recommendation

Given conflicting information, tourists should:
1. Verify current regulations directly with Thai authorities or licensed clinics
2. Not assume accessibility based on outdated information
3. Keep all prescriptions and receipts if obtained legally
4. Exercise extreme caution

## 6. Specific Risks for Foreigners (Tourists and Expats)

### Legal Risks

| Offense | Penalty |
|---------|---------|
| Public consumption | Up to 25,000 THB fine + up to 3 months imprisonment |
| Unlicensed possession | Up to 1 year imprisonment + 20,000 THB fine |
| Illegal sales | Criminal prosecution, business closure, blacklisting |
| Smuggling/Import | Immediate seizure and prosecution |
| Export (any amount) | Strictly illegal - severe penalties |

### High-Risk Scenarios for Tourists

1. **Assuming legality based on 2022-2024 rules**
   - Many tourists arrive expecting recreational cannabis to be legal
   - The June 2025 changes are not widely known internationally

2. **Purchasing from unlicensed vendors**
   - Cannabis openly sold in tourist areas may not be legal
   - Many vendors operate without proper licenses
   - Products marketed for smoking to walk-in customers may be illegal

3. **Public consumption**
   - Cannabis smoke considered a public nuisance
   - Prohibited in parks, streets, public spaces
   - Near educational or religious institutions - severe penalties

4. **Attempting to leave Thailand with cannabis**
   - Absolutely prohibited under any circumstances
   - Even small amounts can result in serious charges

5. **Relying on foreign prescriptions**
   - Foreign medical documentation is NOT valid in Thailand
   - You cannot bring your own cannabis from abroad

### Areas of Heightened Enforcement

- Tourist areas (police may be especially vigilant)
- Near schools and religious sites
- International airports and borders

### Key Warnings

- **Ignorance of the law is never accepted as a defense in Thai courts**
- Penalties can include heavy fines, imprisonment, and deportation
- Police treat cannabis infractions seriously since June 2025 tightening
- Do not assume products on display are legal or safe

### Recommendations for Foreigners

1. **Verify current laws** before traveling - regulations change frequently
2. **Never possess cannabis** without a valid Thai prescription
3. **Keep all documentation** (prescriptions, receipts) on hand
4. **Consume only in private spaces** if legally prescribed
5. **Never attempt to transport** cannabis into or out of Thailand
6. **Consult legal counsel** if operating any cannabis-related business

---

## 7. Pending Legislation

### Cannabis and Hemp Act (Draft Bill)

**Status:** Under review by Cabinet and Parliament

**Timeline:** Originally expected Q2 2025, currently stalled

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Cannabis Control Board (CCB)**
   - New governing body to oversee industry
   - Will develop comprehensive regulatory framework
   - Will set THC content limits for various products

2. **Unified Licensing System**
   - Anyone cultivating, selling, or processing cannabis/hemp must be licensed by CCB
   - Licenses for cultivation, production, import, export, and sale

3. **Standardized Regulations**
   - Clear definitions and harmonized rules
   - Complete penalty structure
   - Unified enforcement framework

### Current Regulatory Gaps

Until the Cannabis & Hemp Act passes:

- **No single cannabis law** - fragmented ministerial directives
- **No unified licensing authority** - multiple agencies involved
- **No complete enforcement framework** - inconsistent application
- **No harmonized definitions** - legal ambiguity remains
- **No comprehensive penalty structure** - varying consequences

### Political Uncertainty

- Anutin Charnvirakul (architect of 2022 decriminalization) is now Prime Minister (as of September 2025)
- Raises questions about potential future policy reversals
- Political instability has directly impacted cannabis policy
