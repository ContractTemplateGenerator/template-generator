## Duration and Validity

### The 5-Year Multiple Entry Explained

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Visa Validity** | 5 years from date of issue |
| **Stay Per Entry** | Up to 180 days |

## Tax Implications

### Tax Residency Status

**You become a Thai tax resident if you stay 180+ days in a calendar year.**

### Key Tax Rules (2024 Changes)

As of January 1, 2024, Thailand updated its tax code:

| Income Type | Tax Status |
|-------------|------------|
| Foreign income earned and remitted in same year | **Taxable** in Thailand |
| Foreign income earned and remitted after that year | Generally **exempt** |
| Income kept outside Thailand | **Not taxable** |
| Pre-2024 savings remitted to Thailand | **Tax-free** (with proof) |

### Progressive Tax Rates

| Annual Income (THB) | Tax Rate |
|--------------------|----------|
| 0 - 150,000 | 0% |
| 150,001 - 300,000 | 5% |
| 300,001 - 500,000 | 10% |
| 500,001 - 750,000 | 15% |
| 750,001 - 1,000,000 | 20% |
| 1,000,001 - 2,000,000 | 25% |
| 2,000,001 - 5,000,000 | 30% |
| Over 5,000,000 | 35% |

### Tax Filing Requirements

- Must obtain Tax ID from local Revenue Department if tax resident
- File tax return if foreign-sourced income remitted exceeds 120,000 THB
- For married couples filing jointly: 220,000 THB threshold

### Proposed 2025 Tax Relief (Not Yet Law)

A proposed Royal Decree suggests:
- Foreign income remitted within 12 months of earning may be tax-exempt
- Example: Income earned in 2025, transferred before end of 2026 = no Thai tax
- **Note:** This is still a proposal and may change

### Practical Tax Strategies

1. **Keep foreign income outside Thailand** - Not taxable
2. **Document pre-2024 savings** - Can be remitted tax-free
3. **Consider timing of remittances** - Based on when income was earned
4. **Check Double Tax Agreements** - Your home country may have treaty with Thailand
5. **Consult a tax professional** - Rules are complex and evolving
