## 6. How BOI Bypasses FBA Restrictions

### Legal Framework

The Foreign Business Act (FBA) B.E. 2542 (1999) typically restricts foreign ownership to 49.99% for most business activities. BOI promotion provides a statutory exemption under Section 8 of the FBA.

### Mechanism

| Aspect | FBA Restriction | BOI Exemption |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Foreign ownership | Limited to 49.99% | Up to 100% (with approval) |
| Land ownership | Generally prohibited | Permitted for approved projects |
| Work permits | 4:1 Thai-to-foreign ratio | Exempted |
| Business activities | List 2/3 restricted | Permitted for promoted activities |

### Key Points

- BOI promotion is granted under Investment Promotion Act B.E. 2520 (1977)
- Exemption only applies to the specific approved activity
- Full foreign ownership must be expressly granted in BOI approval letter
- Must maintain alignment with approved business activities

### Alternative Routes to 100% Foreign Ownership

| Method | Requirements | Applicable To |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **BOI Promotion** | Meet BOI criteria | Priority sectors |
| **Treaty of Amity** | U.S. citizens/companies only | Most activities except certain restricted |
| **Capital Exemption** | THB 100 million+ capital | Wholesale/retail (List 3) |
| **Manufacturing** | Not on restricted list | All manufacturing |
| **Foreign Business License** | Demonstrate economic contribution | List 2/3 activities |

---

## 7. Success Rates and Common Rejection Reasons

### Main Rejection Reasons

1. **Business Activity Mismatch**
   - Most common reason for rejection
   - Applying for activities not on BOI's promoted list
   - Attempting to fit business into categories for tax benefits without meeting operational requirements

2. **Documentation Errors**
   - Missing documents
   - Incorrect information
   - Inadequate translations
   - Can delay applications by months

3. **Staffing Non-Compliance**
   - Failure to maintain 70% Thai nationals (manufacturing with 100+ staff)
   - Incomplete employment documentation
   - Missing social security filings

4. **Value-Added Deficiency**
   - Projects failing to meet 20% value-added threshold
   - Insufficient local content

5. **Certification Failures**
   - Not obtaining ISO 9000/14000 within required timeframe
   - Missing required accreditations

### Success Factors

- Clear alignment between business activities and BOI category
- Complete and accurate documentation
- Realistic financial projections (including anticipated losses)
- Strong market analysis and competitive positioning
- Demonstrated benefit to Thailand's economic development
- Actionable training plans for Thai employees

### Important Considerations

- **No guaranteed approval**: Even meeting all criteria doesn't ensure approval
- **BOI discretion**: Approval based on investment plan, economic impact, and industry
- **Full disclosure**: Don't hide potential losses in early stages
- **Professional preparation**: Single mistakes can prevent approval

### Assessment Criteria

The BOI evaluates:
- Company's ability to carry out proposed activities
- Project's contribution to Thailand's economic goals
- Technology transfer and knowledge sharing plans
- Employment generation
- Export potential
