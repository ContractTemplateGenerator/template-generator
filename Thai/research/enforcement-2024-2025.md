## 7. Red Flags That Trigger Investigations

### Financial Red Flags

1. **Inadequate Capital Sources**
   - Thai shareholders lacking proof of funds for share subscriptions
   - No verifiable income source for claimed investments

2. **Dividend Distribution Anomalies**
   - Absence of proportionate dividend income to Thai shareholders
   - Profits not matching equity positions

3. **Suspicious Payment Patterns**
   - Disguised management fees paid to foreigners
   - Consulting/royalty fees that leak profits to foreign parties
   - Bank records showing nominee shareholders receiving payments from foreigners

### Structural Red Flags

4. **Passive Thai Shareholders**
   - Same Thai individuals appearing in multiple unrelated companies
   - Thai shareholders with no genuine business involvement (taxi drivers, housekeepers as majority shareholders)
   - Shareholders unable to explain business operations

5. **Corporate Filing Inconsistencies**
   - Discrepancies between DBD records and tax returns
   - Mismatches in payroll data and work-permit files
   - Conflicting UBO/AML disclosures

6. **Control Signal Indicators**
   - Foreigners signing contracts, authorizing payments, setting policy
   - Email trails showing foreign decision-making
   - Board minutes indicating foreign control

### Timing/Behavior Red Flags

7. **Sudden Ownership Changes**
   - Ownership transfers before applying for Foreign Business License (FBL)
   - Restructuring in anticipation of enforcement actions

8. **Registration Patterns**
   - Rapid increase in company registrations (e.g., Phuket Russian companies)
   - Shell companies with no genuine business activity

### AI-Powered Detection

**Automated Flags:**
- Algorithms identify high-risk patterns
- Multiple companies using same passive Thai shareholders
- "Dormant" company patterns
- Cross-referencing of multi-agency databases in real-time
