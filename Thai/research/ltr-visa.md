## Overview

The Thailand Long-Term Resident (LTR) Visa is a 10-year visa program launched in September 2022, designed to attract high-potential foreigners who wish to relocate to Thailand on a long-term basis. The program is administered by the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI), not traditional immigration channels, as it was created specifically for economic development purposes.

**Program Goals:**
- Original target: 1 million new residents by 2026
- As of late 2024: Over 6,000 visas approved
- Economic impact: Over THB 23 billion (approximately USD 651 million)

**Key Benefits at a Glance:**
- 10-year visa (two 5-year terms)
- Multiple re-entry privileges
- Annual reporting instead of 90-day reporting
- Fast-track airport immigration services
- Work permit eligibility (category dependent)
- Tax benefits (category dependent)
- No re-entry permit required

## 10-Year Duration and Renewal

### Visa Structure
The LTR visa is structured as two consecutive 5-year terms:

| Phase | Duration | Cost |
|-------|----------|------|
| Initial Grant | 5 years | THB 50,000 (~USD 1,500) |
| Extension | 5 years | FREE |
| **Total** | **10 years** | **THB 50,000** |

### Extension Process

1. **Timeline:** Submit renewal application before first 5-year term expires
2. **BOI Re-endorsement:** Must obtain new qualification endorsement from BOI
3. **Deadline:** Apply for visa within 60 days of receiving endorsement letter
4. **Dependents:** Each dependent must file and re-link their own applications

### Ongoing Requirements to Maintain Visa

All original qualifying conditions must be maintained throughout the visa period:
- Investment amounts (Wealthy Global Citizens)
- Employment status (Highly-Skilled, Work-from-Thailand)
- Bank account balances
- Health insurance coverage
- Asset thresholds

### Revocation Triggers
Your LTR visa may be revoked if:
- Investment in Thailand falls below USD 500,000 (e.g., property sale)
- Health insurance lapses without proof of continuous coverage
- Failure to maintain qualifying income or employment
- Failure to complete annual reporting

### Annual Reporting
- Required once per year (vs. 90 days for most Thai visas)
- Report current residential address to immigration
- Significantly reduces administrative burden

## Tax Benefits

### Overview by Category

| Category | Tax Benefit |
|----------|-------------|
| Wealthy Global Citizens | Exempt from Thai tax on foreign-source income |
| Wealthy Pensioners | Exempt from Thai tax on foreign-source income |
| Work-from-Thailand Professionals | Exempt from Thai tax on foreign-source income |
| Highly-Skilled Professionals | Flat 17% rate on Thai employment income |

### 17% Flat Tax Rate (Highly-Skilled Professionals Only)

**How it Works:**
- Flat 17% personal income tax rate on eligible Thai employment income
- Significant reduction from Thailand's progressive rates (5%-35%)
- Established under Royal Decree No. 743

**Qualification Requirements:**
- Must be employed under contract with a Thai company in a targeted industry
- Position must be in a strategic sector (health, research, renewable energy, etc.)
- Employer can be a company, university, research center, public body, or training center

### Foreign Income Exemption (Other Categories)

**Eligible Categories:**
- Wealthy Global Citizens
- Wealthy Pensioners
- Work-from-Thailand Professionals

**Scope of Exemption:**
- 100% exemption from Thai personal income tax on foreign-sourced income
- Applies to both:
  - Foreign active income (income from work/activities abroad)
  - Foreign passive income (income from assets located abroad)
- Applies regardless of when income is earned or remitted to Thailand

### Important Notes

1. **Mutually Exclusive:** The 17% flat rate and foreign income exemption are mutually exclusive - you cannot claim both
2. **2024 Rule Change:** Thailand updated rules requiring tax residents (183+ days/year) to pay tax on foreign income remitted to Thailand - LTR holders in eligible categories are EXEMPT from this change
3. **Tax Residency:** LTR visa holders who stay 183+ days are still considered tax residents but receive the category-specific benefits above

| Target (2022-2026) | 1,000,000 |
| Achievement Rate | ~0.6% of target |

**Applicant Demographics:**
| Region/Country | Percentage | Number |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| Europe | 42% | ~2,500 |
| United States | 19% | ~1,080 |

### Approval Rate Notes
The BOI does not publish specific approval/rejection percentages. The relatively low total numbers (6,000 vs. 1,000,000 target) suggest either:
- High qualification barriers deterring applications
- Significant rejection rates
- Limited awareness of program

The January 2025 reforms aim to address the first two issues.
