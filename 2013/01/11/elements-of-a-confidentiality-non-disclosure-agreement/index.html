Mutual NDA’s are common when both parties discuss potential joint business ventures.<br />2. <b>Scope</b>. Defines what information is deemed confidential and whether it should clearly be marked as such.<br />3. <b>Permitted Use and Disclosure</b> define what can the information be utilized for and who else may have access to it. NDA may contain a clause stating that the receiving party must give notice to the disclosing party prior to passing that information on to the third parties for permitted uses. Such third parties (e.g. <i>employees, consultants) must then agree to confidentiality obligations at least as protective of the confidential information as those in the original NDA</i>. In any case, the recipient of information shall not be allowed to use it for any purpose other than the evaluation or negotiation of the proposed transaction.<br />4. <b>Term of the Agreement and Duration of Obligation</b> are not necessarily the same thing. It’s a good idea to state that the obligation of confidentiality survives the termination of the NDA for a period of X years after such termination.<br />5. <b>Consequences of a Breach</b> may be a combination or all of the following: a) fixed-sum amount per breach (“liquidated damages”), b) injunctive relief (court order), c) indemnification (the breaching party reimburses the innocent party for expenses of enforcement including attorney fees).<br />6. <b>Jurisdiction and Choice of Law</b> state where the confidentiality agreement will have to be enforced. This is particularly important if the negotiating parties are in different states or countries.</p>

<ol start="39">
<li>How does an NDA differ from a non-compete agreement? An NDA and a non-compete agreement are two different types of legal agreements that serve different purposes.

An NDA can be used to protect confidential information, but it cannot be used to prevent an employee from leaving and starting a competing business.

However, non-compete agreements may be subject to certain legal restrictions and may not be enforceable in all jurisdictions.</li>

<li>How can an NDA be terminated? An NDA can be terminated if both parties agree in writing to do so. This written agreement should be signed by both parties and outline the terms and conditions of the termination. Alternatively, an NDA may specify the conditions under which it will automatically terminate, such as after a certain period of time or when the confidential information is no longer deemed confidential.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="43">
<li>Is it possible to have an NDA without a written agreement? It is possible to have an NDA without a written agreement, but it is not advisable. NDAs are legal agreements that are enforceable in a court of law, and it is recommended that all NDAs be in writing to avoid disputes or misunderstandings. A written NDA provides a clear and unambiguous record of the terms and conditions of the agreement, which can be used as evidence in the event of a breach.</li>
