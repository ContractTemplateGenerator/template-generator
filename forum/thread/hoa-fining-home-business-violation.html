                    <p>This is a common issue, especially post-COVID when remote work exploded. Let me break down the legal framework:</p>
                    <p><strong>General principle:</strong> Working remotely as a W-2 employee is typically NOT considered a "home business" under most HOA CC&Rs. The restrictions usually target commercial operations that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generate customer/client traffic</li>
                        <li>Require business signage</li>
                        <li>Store commercial inventory or equipment</li>
                        <li>Create noise, odors, or nuisances</li>
                        <li>Change the residential character of the property</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, the specific language in YOUR CC&Rs matters. Can you share what the exact restriction says?</p>

                    <p>Perfect. That language is fairly standard and actually helps your case.</p>
                    <p>Here's why you should win this dispute:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>No commercial activity being "conducted":</strong> You're not running a business, you're an employee. The business is conducted by your employer, not at your residence.</li>
                        <li><strong>Residential use:</strong> Using a home office for remote employment is absolutely a residential purpose. Courts have consistently held this.</li>
                        <li><strong>No change in character:</strong> There's no external evidence of commercial activity (no customers, signs, deliveries, etc.)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>I'd write a formal response citing these points and requesting they withdraw the fine. If they refuse, you may need to request a hearing with the HOA board.</p>

                    <p>Great point about Florida procedure. Under FS 720.305, the HOA must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide at least 14 days written notice of the alleged violation</li>
                        <li>Offer you an opportunity to be heard before the board or committee</li>
                        <li>Allow you to present evidence and witnesses</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If they just sent you a fine notice without following this process, the fine is invalid.</p>
                    <p>Here's what I recommend:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Send a written response disputing the fine</li>
                        <li>Request a hearing (if they didn't already offer one)</li>
                        <li>Prepare a brief statement explaining you're a remote employee, not running a business</li>
                        <li>Cite the CC&R language and explain why it doesn't apply</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Update: I requested a hearing and sent a detailed letter explaining that remote employment is not a commercial activity. I also pointed out they didn't follow the 14-day notice requirement.</p>
                    <p>The HOA board president called me (!) and said they're withdrawing the fine. Apparently the management company issued it without board approval based on the neighbor complaint.</p>
                    <p>Crisis averted. But I'm seriously considering moving out of this HOA when my lease is up. This was stressful for no reason.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for all the advice everyone!</p>

                    <p>This exact scenario just happened to me in Arizona. HOA sent me a violation notice for "operating a business from home" because I work remotely as a software engineer. My neighbor apparently complained about seeing delivery trucks (which are just my Amazon packages, not business-related).</p>
                    <p>Following the advice in this thread - I reviewed my CC&Rs and there's nothing prohibiting remote work, only "commercial enterprises" which courts have consistently interpreted as client-facing businesses with signage, foot traffic, or inventory.</p>
                    <p>Sending them a response letter tomorrow citing the distinction between employment and commercial activity. Glad to see OP's HOA backed down when challenged. These management companies are way too trigger-happy with fines.</p>
