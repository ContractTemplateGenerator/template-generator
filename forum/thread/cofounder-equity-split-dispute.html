                    <p>Started an LLC with my co-founder 8 months ago. 60/40 split, I'm the 60. We have a basic operating agreement from LegalZoom but I honestly don't remember what it says about leaving.</p>
                    <p>He just told me he's taking a job at Google and can't continue. The company isn't profitable yet but we have a working product and some early traction. If he walks with 40%, I'm stuck with a dead weight cap table forever.</p>
                    <p>Is there anything I can do? Does vesting exist for LLC founders?</p>

                    <p>First: pull out your operating agreement and read it carefully. Look for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Vesting" provisions — do members earn their ownership over time?</li>
                        <li>"Repurchase rights" — can the company buy back units when someone leaves?</li>
                        <li>"Capital call" provisions — is there a buyout mechanism?</li>
                        <li>Restrictions on transfer</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If your LegalZoom agreement doesn't have vesting (most don't), then legally he owns 40% outright. The equity was granted at formation, not earned over time.</p>

                    <p>Just read it. No vesting. He owns his 40% "membership interest" outright. There's a right of first refusal if he tries to sell, but nothing about leaving the company.</p>

                    <p>Legally, yes, he owns the 40%. But you have negotiation leverage:</p>
                    <p>1. He probably doesn't want to be a passive minority owner in a company where his ex-cofounder makes all the decisions and can dilute him.</p>
                    <p>2. If you ever raise money, investors will ask about the cap table. A departed co-founder with 40% is a red flag — you'll have leverage to clean it up.</p>
                    <p>3. His Google job probably has conflict-of-interest policies. Holding equity in an outside company may create problems for him.</p>
                    <p>Approach him about a voluntary buyback. Offer to buy back his shares at a reasonable valuation (probably low given no revenue). Many departing founders accept 5-10% of what they originally held rather than dealing with ongoing obligations.</p>

                    <p>Been on both sides of this. When I left my second startup after 6 months (health reasons), I voluntarily returned most of my equity. Kept 5% for my contributions. It was the fair thing to do.</p>
                    <p>When someone left one of my companies after a year with no vesting, I offered him a buyout at fair value (basically nothing — we were pre-revenue). He took $5,000 for his 25%. Worth it to have a clean cap table.</p>
                    <p>Have an honest conversation. If he's a decent person, he'll understand that 40% for 8 months of work isn't fair to you or the future of the company.</p>

                    <p>If you plan to raise VC, expect this conversation:</p>
                    <p>VC: "Who owns 40% of the company?"<br>
                    You: "My former co-founder who left after 8 months."<br>
                    VC: "Can you buy him out?"<br>
                    You: "I don't have that right."<br>
                    VC: "Then we need to fix that before we invest."</p>
                    <p>VCs hate dead equity. They'll either demand you clean up the cap table or pass. Use that as ammunition in your negotiation — "If I can't raise money because of your 40%, the company dies and your shares are worth zero."</p>

                    <p>Alternative perspective: don't be too aggressive. If you burn the relationship, he could become an obstructionist. 40% is enough to block certain decisions in most operating agreements. Make sure you know what requires member approval vs manager approval.</p>
                    <p>Approach it as "let's figure out what's fair for both of us" not "you don't deserve this."</p>

                    <p>UPDATE: Had the conversation. Went better than expected. He admitted that keeping 40% while doing nothing feels wrong. We agreed in principle:</p>
                    <p>- He keeps 8% (roughly 1% per month he worked, rounded up)<br>
                    - I buy back the remaining 32% for $10K (he gets something tangible)<br>
                    - Clean break, no ongoing obligations for either of us</p>
                    <p>Getting the paperwork drafted now. Will also add proper vesting to the operating agreement for any future members.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Get a full release of claims from both sides</li>
