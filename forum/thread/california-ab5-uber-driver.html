                    <p>I drove for 3 years and finally gave up. The contractor status means you're absorbing all the costs - vehicle depreciation, maintenance, gas, insurance. After expenses my effective hourly was below minimum wage.</p>
                    <p>One thing you CAN do is deduct all those expenses on Schedule C since you're self-employed. Standard mileage deduction is 67 cents/mile for 2024, 70 cents for 2025. That helps at tax time at least.</p>

                    <p>Yeah I do the mileage deduction. Helps some but still feels like I'm getting screwed compared to if I was W-2.</p>
                    <p>Are there any other states that classified rideshare as employees? Wondering if I should just move lol.</p>

                    <p>No state has successfully reclassified rideshare drivers as employees. Massachusetts tried with a 2024 ballot measure (Question 3) but it failed. New York has some additional protections for drivers but they're still contractors.</p>
                    <p>The gig companies have spent hundreds of millions on ballot measures and lobbying to maintain contractor status. California's Prop 22 was the template - they've pushed similar measures in other states.</p>
                    <p>Bottom line: contractor status for rideshare is not changing anytime soon. If you want employment benefits, you'll need to transition to traditional employment. Many logistics companies, delivery services, and transportation companies do hire W-2 drivers.</p>

                    <p>Appreciate all the info. Frustrating but at least I understand the situation now. Going to look into those class actions about the earnings guarantee calculations - pretty sure Uber has been shorting me on that.</p>

                    <p>Revisiting this thread because there's been a significant development. In October 2025, a federal judge ruled that parts of Prop 22 violate the National Labor Relations Act. The ruling says that Prop 22's restrictions on driver organizing and collective bargaining are illegal under federal law.</p>
                    <p>This doesn't mean we're automatically employees now, but it opens the door for drivers to organize and collectively negotiate with Uber/Lyft without retaliation. Some drivers in SF are already forming a union-like group.</p>
                    <p>The case is being appealed but it's the first major legal victory against Prop 22 since it passed. Might be worth following if you're interested in pushing for better protections.</p>
