                    <p>Hired a contractor to remodel our kitchen. During the work, his crew dropped a heavy appliance that gouged and cracked about 200 sq ft of our original hardwood floors in the living room (adjacent to kitchen).</p>
                    <p>Damage estimate is $8,500 to repair/replace the affected section and match the finish. Contractor is saying "file a claim with my insurance" but also hinting I could just file with my homeowner's insurance.</p>
                    <p>What's the right move here? I'm worried about my homeowner's premium going up for something that wasn't my fault. House is in Portland, OR.</p>

                    <p>Do NOT file with your homeowner's insurance. This is exactly what the contractor's general liability insurance is for.</p>
                    <p>If you file with your own insurance:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You'll pay your deductible (typically $1,000-$2,500)</li>
                        <li>Your premiums will likely increase</li>
                        <li>It counts as a claim on your record, which can affect future insurability</li>
                        <li>You're essentially letting the contractor off the hook</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The contractor should have general liability insurance that covers property damage caused during work. Ask for his insurance information and file a claim directly with his carrier.</p>

                    <p>Been through this exact scenario. Contractor broke a window during siding replacement. I filed with HIS insurance. Took about 3 weeks but they paid the full claim, no deductible for me, zero impact on my homeowner's policy.</p>
                    <p>Get the contractor's insurance certificate and policy number in writing. If he's licensed (which he should be in Oregon), he's required to have liability insurance.</p>

                    <p>Thanks @JenniferM_Law. The contractor did give me a certificate of insurance when we started the project. Should I contact his insurance company directly or ask him to file the claim?</p>
                    <p>Also, he's been kind of dodgy since the damage happened. Not returning calls as quickly. Worried he's going to drag his feet on this.</p>

                    <p>You can file the claim directly with his insurance carrier as a third-party claimant. You don't need the contractor's permission or cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Call the insurance company listed on the certificate</li>
                        <li>Report the damage as a third-party property damage claim</li>
                        <li>Provide details, photos, and your repair estimate</li>
                        <li>They'll assign an adjuster to investigate</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Document everything: take extensive photos of the damage, get multiple written repair estimates, keep all communication in writing (email, text).</p>
                    <p>The fact that he's going quiet is a red flag. File the claim ASAP before too much time passes.</p>

                    <p>Just a thought - before you go the insurance route, did you ask the contractor to just pay for it directly? $8,500 might be below his deductible or he might want to avoid an insurance claim on his record too.</p>
                    <p>Some contractors will just cut you a check to avoid the hassle and premium increase. Worth asking.</p>

                    <p>@DIY_Nate makes a fair point. You could offer the contractor a choice: "Pay $8,500 directly within 10 days, or I'll file with your insurance carrier."</p>
                    <p>If he pays directly, get a written settlement agreement stating:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>He's paying $8,500 for the floor damage</li>

                    <p>Update: finally got him on the phone. He's claiming the damage was "pre-existing" and that our floors were already damaged. Complete BS - we have before photos from the listing when we bought the house 2 years ago showing the floors were perfect.</p>
                    <p>He's now saying he won't file a claim and I should "take it up with his insurance if I want." Super frustrating. Guess I'm filing the claim myself.</p>

                    <p>The before photos are gold. Make sure you include those with your claim to the insurance company.</p>

                    <p>I manage 40+ rental properties and deal with contractor damage claims regularly. Few additional tips:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check if you withheld any payment from the contractor - don't release final payment until this is resolved</li>
                        <li>Oregon requires contractors to be bonded as well as insured - if insurance doesn't cover it, you can go after the bond</li>
                        <li>File a complaint with Oregon CCB (Construction Contractors Board) - this creates a record and they can help mediate</li>

                    <p>Quick update: filed the claim with his insurance company on Friday. They assigned an adjuster who's coming out Wednesday to inspect. I still have the 15% final payment ($3,200) that I haven't released.</p>
                    <p>Also found text messages from right after it happened where the contractor said "we'll get this fixed for you, just give me a few days to figure out the best approach." Pretty clear admission of responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Will update after the adjuster visit. Thanks everyone for the advice.</p>

                    <p>Perfect - that text message is an admission of liability. The insurance adjuster will definitely want to see that.</p>
                    <p>And smart move holding the final payment. Do NOT release it until the floor repair is fully complete or you receive payment for the damage. That's your leverage.</p>
                    <p>One more thing: if the insurance company offers a settlement, you can negotiate. Their first offer is often low. Get multiple independent repair estimates to support your position.</p>
