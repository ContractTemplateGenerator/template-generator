                    <p>I'm a graphic designer on Upwork. Signed a contract for a logo design with "2 rounds of revisions included" clearly stated in the scope of work. Client approved my initial design, then asked for minor tweaks (round 1). I delivered those.</p>
                    <p>Now they're asking for a complete redesign with totally different concepts. When I said that would be a new project or additional fee, they're threatening to dispute the payment and leave a bad review. They're claiming "unlimited revisions until satisfied" should be implied.</p>
                    <p>The contract is for $800. I've already spent 12 hours on this. What are my options?</p>

                    <p>You have a written contract that explicitly states "2 rounds of revisions." That's your armor here.</p>
                    <p>Basic contract law principle: when terms are clearly defined in writing, courts don't read in additional implied terms that contradict the express language. "2 rounds" means 2 rounds, not unlimited.</p>

                    <p>I've been freelancing on Upwork for 6 years. This is a super common problem. Here's what I do:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Screenshot EVERYTHING - the original contract, all messages, all work submitted, their approvals</li>
                        <li>Don't do any more work outside the contract scope</li>
                        <li>Respond professionally in Upwork messages (not email) explaining you've completed the contracted scope</li>
                        <li>Offer a new contract for additional work at your hourly rate</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If they dispute, Upwork will review the message history. As long as you documented everything, you'll win the dispute.</p>

                    <p>Your contract language is excellent - very specific and unambiguous. "Up to 2 rounds of revisions based on selected concept" makes it crystal clear that:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>There's a maximum of 2 revision rounds</li>
                        <li>Revisions are modifications to the selected concept, not new concepts</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The client asking for "totally different concepts" is requesting work outside the scope of the contract. This would constitute a material change requiring a contract modification or new agreement.</p>
                    <p>Marcus's advice is spot-on. Document everything and keep all communication on the Upwork platform.</p>

                    <p>I literally train people on Upwork best practices. Some things about Upwork's dispute process:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Upwork will review the original contract scope and all platform messages</li>
                        <li>They heavily favor clear, written scope over "he said, she said"</li>
                        <li>If you completed the stated deliverables, you'll win the dispute</li>
                        <li>The client threatening a bad review is actually against Upwork TOS (feedback extortion)</li>

                    <p>Report the review threat to Upwork support. That's a serious violation and they take it very seriously. Could get the client suspended.</p>

                    <p>This exact thing happened to me last year. Client wanted unlimited revisions on a website design. I had "3 rounds" in my contract.</p>
                    <p>I stuck to my contract, they disputed the payment, Upwork reviewed it and released the full payment to me within 5 days. The client's account got flagged for the review threat too.</p>
                    <p>Best advice: never deviate from your stated scope, no matter how much they push. The second you do extra work "as a courtesy" you set a precedent that the contract doesn't matter.</p>

                    <p>Let me add some legal context around the "implied unlimited revisions" argument the client is making:</p>
                    <p>Under contract law, courts will only imply terms when:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The term is necessary to give the contract business efficacy (the contract wouldn't work without it), OR</li>
                        <li>The term is so obvious it "goes without saying"</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Neither applies here. The contract works perfectly fine with 2 rounds stated explicitly. And unlimited revisions is definitely not "so obvious it goes without saying" - in fact, creative services contracts almost always limit revisions specifically to prevent scope creep.</p>
                    <p>The legal doctrine that helps you here is "expressio unius est exclusio alterius" - the expression of one thing excludes others. By stating "2 rounds," the contract implicitly excludes 3, 4, or unlimited rounds.</p>

                    <p>Update: I reported the feedback threat to Upwork support and sent the professional message that Nina suggested.</p>
                    <p>The client responded pretty angrily but didn't dispute the payment. They just closed the contract and left a mediocre review (3 stars, said I was "inflexible" but admitted the work quality was good).</p>
                    <p>Upwork support responded and said they're reviewing the client's account for TOS violations. They also said the review may be removed if they determine it was retaliatory.</p>

                    <p>Glad this worked out. For other freelancers reading this thread, some best practices to avoid this situation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Define "revision" vs "new concept"</strong> - Be explicit about what constitutes a revision versus new work</li>
                        <li><strong>Specify revision timeline</strong> - "2 rounds of revisions, each round submitted within 5 business days of receiving feedback"</li>
                        <li><strong>Include approval language</strong> - "Client approval of initial concept required before revisions begin. Approved concepts cannot be changed to different concepts without new contract."</li>
                        <li><strong>State what's NOT included</strong> - Sometimes saying what's excluded is as important as what's included</li>
                        <li><strong>Have a change order process</strong> - Include language like "Any work outside this scope requires a written change order at Designer's standard hourly rate of $X"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Crystal clear contracts prevent 90% of these disputes.</p>
