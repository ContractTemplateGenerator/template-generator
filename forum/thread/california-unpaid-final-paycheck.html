                    <p>This happened to me in 2023. California has "waiting time penalties" which basically means the employer owes you a full day's wages for EVERY DAY they're late, up to 30 days.</p>
                    <p>If you make $200/day and they're 5 days late, that's an extra $1,000 in penalties on top of your regular pay. It adds up fast. Companies in CA really don't want to mess around with this.</p>

                    <p>@Marcus_K is correct. Labor Code Section 203 imposes waiting time penalties - up to 30 days of wages as a penalty for willful failure to pay on time.</p>
                    <p>Here's what I recommend you do today:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Send a formal written demand (email is fine) to HR and any company officer you can identify. State clearly: "I was terminated on July 11, 2025 and have not received my final paycheck as required by California Labor Code 201. I demand immediate payment of all wages owed including accrued vacation."</li>
                        <li>Document everything - save all emails, texts, termination paperwork</li>
                        <li>Calculate your daily wage rate (annual salary ÷ 260 workdays, or hourly rate × 8)</li>
                        <li>If they don't pay within 72 hours of your demand, file a wage claim with the California Labor Commissioner</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The penalties clock started on July 11, so you're already entitled to 5 days of penalty wages as of today.</p>

                    <p>Wait, so if my daily rate is $160 and they're 5 days late, they owe me an extra $800 on top of my $3,200 owed? That seems like a lot but I'm not complaining.</p>

                    <p>This often lights a fire under HR because most California employers know how expensive this can get. I've seen cases where a $5,000 final paycheck turned into a $20,000+ liability because payroll "forgot" about the terminated employee.</p>
                    <p>Also make sure your vacation time is included - California treats accrued vacation as earned wages, so that must be paid out immediately too.</p>

                    <p>They're overnighting a check today for the full amount owed plus 6 days of waiting time penalties ($960). Should arrive tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>Good outcome. The fact that they immediately agreed to pay penalties suggests they got advice from counsel. Most sophisticated employers will just pay rather than fight because:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The penalties are statutory - there's no discretion for a judge to waive them</li>
                        <li>The employer bears the burden of proving the delay was NOT willful (very hard to prove)</li>
                        <li>You can also recover attorney fees if you have to sue</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Make sure that check actually arrives and clears. If it doesn't, the penalty clock keeps running and you file with the Labor Commissioner immediately.</p>

                    <p>For anyone reading this thread who runs payroll in California - some lesser-known rules:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Involuntary termination:</strong> Payment due immediately (same day)</li>
                        <li><strong>Voluntary resignation with 72+ hours notice:</strong> Payment due on last day of work</li>
                        <li><strong>Voluntary resignation without notice:</strong> Payment due within 72 hours</li>
                        <li><strong>Layoffs/plant closures:</strong> Still immediate payment required</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There's no grace period. No "next regular payday" exception. California doesn't play around.</p>
                    <p>Also, if you're a remote employee who works for a CA company, these rules apply to you even if you live in another state (recent case law).</p>

                    <p>Final update: Check arrived via FedEx this morning. Deposited it and it's showing as pending. Total was $4,160 ($3,200 regular wages + $960 penalties).</p>
                    <p>Honestly wild that a simple demand letter fixed this in 48 hours. Makes me wonder how many people just accept the delay and don't know their rights.</p>
                    <p>Marking this as resolved. Thanks again everyone, especially @DavidL_EmploymentAtty and @AmyLin_Counsel for the specific guidance.</p>

                    <p>This thread saved me. Just got fired from my retail job in San Diego yesterday (no notice, just "we're letting you go"). Manager said I'd get my final check "on the next payroll cycle" which is 2 weeks away.</p>
                    <p>After reading this I called him back and cited Labor Code 201. He acted like he didn't know about it but said he'd "check with corporate." Two hours later they emailed me saying the check will be ready tomorrow at the store for pickup.</p>
                    <p>California law is no joke. Employers really think they can just delay payment and hope people don't know their rights. Thank you to everyone who shared info in this thread.</p>
