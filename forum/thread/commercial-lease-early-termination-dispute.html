                    <p>I've been leasing a commercial space in Chicago for my restaurant for 2 years (3-year lease, signed Nov 2023). Everything was fine until last month when we had a major rainstorm and discovered the roof has serious leaks.</p>
                    <p>Water poured into the dining area, ruined ceiling tiles, damaged electrical fixtures, and we had to close for 5 days. I immediately notified the landlord in writing. He sent a contractor who "patched" it, but it leaked again during the next rain.</p>
                    <p>It's been 4 weeks now. The space is basically unusable during any rain. I'm losing thousands in revenue every time we have to close. Health inspector came by and flagged potential mold issues.</p>
                    <p>I told my landlord I want to terminate the lease early due to his failure to maintain the property. He says I'm stuck in the lease and still owe rent. I'm paying $4,800/month for a space I can't reliably operate in.</p>
                    <p>Does his failure to fix this give me grounds to break the lease? What are my options here?</p>

                    <p>This sucks, but commercial leases are very different from residential leases. Most commercial leases don't have the same implied warranty of habitability that residential leases have.</p>
                    <p>You need to look at your lease very carefully. Check for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintenance and repair provisions - who's responsible for structural issues like the roof?</li>
                        <li>Remedies section - what can you do if landlord doesn't maintain?</li>
                        <li>Force majeure or casualty clauses</li>
                        <li>Any "quiet enjoyment" language</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Document EVERYTHING. Photos, videos, dates you closed, revenue losses, all communications with landlord.</p>

                    <p>I handle commercial lease disputes in Illinois. This is likely a constructive eviction scenario if the property is truly unusable.</p>
                    <p>In Illinois, even commercial leases have some protections. If the landlord's failure to repair makes the property unsuitable for its intended purpose, you may have grounds to claim constructive eviction.</p>
                    <p>Key requirements for constructive eviction in Illinois:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Landlord breached a duty (like maintaining the roof)</li>
                        <li>The breach substantially interfered with your use of the property</li>
                        <li>You notified landlord and gave reasonable time to fix</li>
                        <li>You actually vacate the premises</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Warning: If you claim constructive eviction and a court disagrees, you could be liable for the full lease term. Don't just walk away without legal advice.</p>

                    <p>I just pulled out my lease. Under "Landlord's Obligations" it says: "Landlord shall maintain the structural integrity of the building including foundation, exterior walls, and roof."</p>
                    <p>There's also a section that says: "In the event of casualty damage that renders more than 50% of the premises unusable, either party may terminate with 30 days notice."</p>
                    <p>The leak affects about 40% of the dining room, so I don't think I hit the 50% threshold. But the "structural integrity" language seems relevant?</p>

                    <p>I went through something similar with a retail space. One thing to consider: have you been withholding rent or still paying?</p>
                    <p>In Illinois you might be able to do "repair and deduct" - hire your own contractor to fix the roof and deduct the cost from rent. But this is risky in commercial leases.</p>
                    <p>Also, check if your business interruption insurance covers this. Some policies cover lost income due to landlord's failure to repair.</p>

                    <p>Good that the lease clearly assigns roof maintenance to landlord. That's your foundation.</p>
                    <p>Next steps I'd recommend:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Send a formal demand letter</strong> citing the lease provision, detailing the issue, your losses, and giving a firm deadline (10-14 days) for completion of repairs</li>
                        <li><strong>Get an independent contractor's assessment</strong> of the roof damage and cost to repair properly</li>
                        <li><strong>Document business losses</strong> - sales reports showing revenue drops on rain days vs. normal days</li>
                        <li><strong>Check local code enforcement</strong> - file a complaint with Chicago Building Dept if the roof violates code</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Don't withhold rent yet - in commercial leases this can put you in default. Keep paying under protest while you build your case.</p>

                    <p>I've been paying rent on time despite all this. Didn't want to give him any excuse to claim I breached.</p>
                    <p>Just got an estimate from a roofing contractor - says the whole section needs to be replaced, not just patched. Estimate is $18,500. I sent it to my landlord asking when he'll schedule the work.</p>
                    <p>He responded saying "the roof was fine when you moved in, this is normal wear and tear." Which is BS because the lease started 2 years ago and roof leaks aren't "normal wear and tear."</p>

                    <p>His "normal wear and tear" argument is ridiculous. Roof maintenance is literally in the lease as his responsibility.</p>
                    <p>You're in a strong position here. The lease says he maintains the roof. You have documentation of the problem, his failed repair attempt, and your business losses.</p>
                    <p>Consider this strategy: Send a formal notice that if repairs aren't completed within 15 days, you'll exercise your right to cure and deduct the repair cost from rent over the next several months. Include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The contractor's estimate</li>
                        <li>Your calculation of how you'll deduct ($18,500 / $4,800 = ~4 months of rent)</li>
                        <li>Reference to the lease provision requiring him to maintain the roof</li>

                    <p>Not a lawyer but I own 3 restaurants in Chicago. Had a similar situation with a grease trap issue my landlord wouldn't fix.</p>
                    <p>File a complaint with the city. When the building inspector shows up and red-tags the issue, landlords suddenly find motivation to fix things. No landlord wants code violations on their property.</p>

                    <p>Update: I filed a complaint with Chicago Building Dept. Inspector came out yesterday and cited my landlord for code violations related to the roof and water damage.</p>
                    <p>Landlord called me within 2 hours of getting the citation. Suddenly he's very interested in fixing this properly. Scheduled a roofing company to start work next week.</p>
                    <p>I also sent him a demand for rent abatement for the 8 days I had to close due to the leak ($4,800 / 30 days = $160/day x 8 days = $1,280). He hasn't responded to that yet but at least the roof is getting fixed.</p>
                    <p>Thanks everyone for the advice. The city complaint was the key.</p>

                    <p>Glad you got results. Code enforcement is often the fastest way to get action from unresponsive landlords.</p>
                    <p>On the rent abatement: Your calculation is reasonable. In Illinois courts, tenants are entitled to rent abatement proportional to the unusable space/time. Keep all documentation of your closure days in case he disputes it.</p>
                    <p>Once the repairs are done, get a written confirmation from the contractor that the roof is properly fixed, not just patched. And take detailed photos of the completed work. This protects you if the issue recurs.</p>
