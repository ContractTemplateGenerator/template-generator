                    <p>Last night's storm knocked down a massive oak tree from my neighbor's yard. It completely destroyed 40 feet of my fence and crushed my storage shed. Probably $8K in damage.</p>
                    <p>My neighbor is saying "act of God, not my problem, call your insurance." Is he right? I told him multiple times over the past year that tree looked dead and dangerous. He never did anything about it.</p>
                    <p>Do I have any recourse here or am I stuck with the bill?</p>

                    <p>The key question is whether your neighbor was negligent. Tree liability generally follows this framework:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Healthy tree + storm = Act of God:</strong> Neighbor not liable. Your insurance covers it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dead/diseased tree + storm = Negligence:</strong> Neighbor likely liable if they knew or should have known about the hazard.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dead tree + no storm = Negligence:</strong> Neighbor definitely liable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You mentioned the tree "looked dead" and you warned him. This is crucial. Do you have any documentation of those warnings? Texts, emails, photos of the tree's condition?</p>

                    <p>Former insurance adjuster here. File with your own homeowner's insurance first. Here's why:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>They'll pay for repairs immediately (minus deductible)</li>
                        <li>If they determine the neighbor was negligent, they'll subrogate - meaning they'll go after the neighbor's insurance to recover what they paid you</li>
                        <li>If subrogation succeeds, you'll get your deductible back</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Going after the neighbor directly means waiting months or years for resolution. Let your insurance handle it - that's literally what you pay them for.</p>

                    <p>North Carolina follows the "rule of reasonableness" for tree disputes. The seminal case is <em>Fancher v. Fagella</em> (2007), which held that a property owner can be liable for damage from trees if they knew or should have known the tree posed an unreasonable risk of harm.</p>
                    <p>Your documented warnings establish actual knowledge. The photos showing visible rot and no foliage establish the "unreasonable risk" element.</p>
                    <p>I'd recommend:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>File with your insurance as Brian suggested</li>
                        <li>Send a formal demand letter to your neighbor (certified mail) with copies of texts and photos</li>
                        <li>If neighbor's insurance denies the claim, consult a local attorney about small claims court (NC limit is $10K) or superior court if damages exceed that</li>

                    <p>I went through this exact situation in Virginia two years ago. Neighbor's tree, warned them it was dying, it fell on my detached garage.</p>
                    <p>What actually happened: Filed with my insurance. They sent an arborist who confirmed the tree was dead before it fell. My insurance paid me, then successfully recovered everything from neighbor's homeowner policy. Got my $1K deductible back about 6 months later.</p>
                    <p>The neighbor and I don't talk anymore though. Just FYI that this will probably ruin the relationship if it hasn't already.</p>

                    <p>Yeah the relationship is already toast. He was incredibly rude when I went over there after the tree fell. Basically told me to get off his property.</p>

                    <p>Generally, you're responsible for removing the portion of the tree on your property, and he's responsible for the portion on his property. This is true even if the whole tree came from his yard.</p>
                    <p>However, if negligence is established, you can potentially recover tree removal costs as part of your damages. Your insurance will likely cover removal of the portions that are on/against your damaged structures. Save all receipts.</p>
                    <p>Don't touch anything on his property without permission - that could create liability for you.</p>

                    <p>I run a tree service. Just want to add - get multiple quotes for removal and repairs. Insurance companies will sometimes lowball using their "preferred contractors."</p>
                    <p>For an oak that size with shed and fence damage, I'd estimate:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tree removal (your side): $1,500-2,500</li>
                        <li>Fence repair (40 ft): $3,000-4,500 depending on fence type</li>
                        <li>Shed: depends if repair or replacement needed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Also, if the adjuster comes out and you disagree with their assessment, you can hire a public adjuster to fight for you. They typically take 10% of the settlement but can get you significantly more.</p>

                    <p>One more thing to document: take lots of photos now before cleanup begins. Photograph:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The tree trunk showing rot/disease</li>
                        <li>Where the tree broke/fell from</li>
                        <li>All damage to your fence and shed from multiple angles</li>
                        <li>The property line so it's clear where the tree originated</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If this ends up in litigation (hopefully not), you'll want comprehensive visual evidence. Photos are much more persuasive to judges and juries than descriptions.</p>

                    <p>Update: Insurance adjuster came out. Took a ton of photos, agreed the tree was clearly dead/diseased before the storm. They're covering everything - fence replacement, new shed, tree removal from my property. Total claim is $9,200.</p>
                    <p>Adjuster said they'll be pursuing the neighbor's insurance for subrogation and I should get my $1,000 deductible back in a few months once that resolves.</p>
                    <p>Thanks everyone for the advice. Really helped me understand my rights and how to handle this properly.</p>
