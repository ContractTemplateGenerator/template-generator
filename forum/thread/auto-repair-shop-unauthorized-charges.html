                    <p>I brought my car to a shop for an oil change and to diagnose a weird noise. Authorized a $120 diagnostic fee over the phone.</p>
                    <p>Shop called and said it's the wheel bearing, estimated $450 to fix. I said "let me think about it" and they said okay.</p>
                    <p>Two days later they call and say the car is ready. I show up and the bill is $2,847. They replaced the wheel bearing, rotors, brake pads, calipers, and did a full transmission flush. I NEVER authorized any of this.</p>
                    <p>Now they're holding my car hostage saying I can't get it back until I pay. They say I signed a work order that gives them authorization to "perform necessary repairs." I don't remember signing anything like that.</p>
                    <p>What are my options here? I'm in Illinois if that matters.</p>

                    <p>As a shop owner, this is sketchy as hell. No legit shop does $2,800 in work without explicit authorization.</p>
                    <p>Even if you signed a general work order, most states require shops to call and get approval if the repairs exceed the estimate by more than 10-20%. $450 to $2,847 is insane.</p>
                    <p>Ask to see the work order you supposedly signed. Take photos of it.</p>

                    <p>Illinois has specific laws about this under the Motor Vehicle Repair Act (815 ILCS 306).</p>
                    <p>Key points:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shops MUST provide a written estimate before doing work over $100</li>
                        <li>They CANNOT exceed the written estimate by more than 10% OR $50 (whichever is greater) without your authorization</li>
                        <li>They cannot hold your car hostage for unauthorized repairs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Since you only authorized the $450 wheel bearing repair (and even that was verbal, not written), they violated the law by doing $2,800 in work.</p>
                    <p>Here's what you should do:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Demand a copy of any signed work authorization in writing</li>
                        <li>File a complaint with the Illinois Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division</li>
                        <li>Tell them you'll pay for the authorized work ($450) plus the diagnostic ($120), but not the rest</li>
                        <li>If they refuse to release the car, file a police report for unlawful retention</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>I went back and asked for the work order. They showed me a form I signed when I dropped the car off. It has a pre-printed clause that says "I authorize [Shop Name] to perform diagnostic services and necessary repairs to ensure vehicle safety."</p>
                    <p>That's it. No dollar amount, no specific repairs listed, nothing. Just that generic language.</p>
                    <p>They're saying that's my authorization. Is that actually valid?</p>

                    <p>NO. That's not valid authorization under Illinois law.</p>
                    <p>The Motor Vehicle Repair Act requires a WRITTEN ESTIMATE that includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Specific description of the work to be done</li>

                    <p>A blanket "necessary repairs" clause doesn't satisfy the statute. They're trying to pull a fast one.</p>
                    <p>Photo that work order. Then send them a written demand (via email and certified mail) that says:</p>
                    <p>"I authorized only the $450 wheel bearing repair and $120 diagnostic fee. The additional $2,277 in repairs were performed without my consent and in violation of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Repair Act (815 ILCS 306/5). I will pay $570 for authorized services. Please release my vehicle immediately or I will file a police report and a complaint with the Attorney General."</p>

                    <p>They can only place a mechanic's lien for work that was properly authorized. A lien for unauthorized work is invalid and you can challenge it.</p>
                    <p>Their aggressive response tells me they know they screwed up. They're hoping to intimidate you into paying.</p>
                    <p>Don't back down. File the complaint with the AG today. Also file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and leave a Google review detailing exactly what happened (stick to facts, no emotional language).</p>
                    <p>If they file a lien, you can sue them for wrongful lien and potentially recover attorney's fees under Illinois law. Most shops won't risk it.</p>

                    <p>Good. The AG will contact them. In my experience, shops fold pretty quickly once the AG gets involved.</p>
                    <p>One more option: tender the $570 (authorized amount) via certified check or money order. Send it certified mail with a letter demanding release of the vehicle. Keep proof you sent it.</p>
                    <p>This shows good faith and undermines any argument that you're refusing to pay for authorized work. It also strengthens your case if you need to sue for wrongful retention of property.</p>

                    <p>FINAL UPDATE: The AG's office contacted the shop on June 9. They called me the same day and said I could pick up the car and we'd "work out payment."</p>
                    <p>I picked up the car yesterday and they had me sign a release agreeing to pay $570 (the authorized amount). They dropped all the other charges.</p>
                    <p>The manager was clearly pissed but didn't say much. Just handed me my keys and said "have a nice day" in the most passive-aggressive tone ever.</p>
                    <p>Thanks everyone for the advice. Filing that AG complaint was 100% the right move.</p>

                    <p>This thread saved me. Had almost the exact same situation last week - brought my car in for an oil change, they called and said I needed new brake pads ($450). I approved that. When I picked up the car they charged me $1,200 saying they also replaced rotors, calipers, and brake fluid.</p>
                    <p>I refused to pay the extra charges and cited the consumer protection statute someone mentioned in this thread. The shop tried to argue that brake work "always includes" those other items but I stood my ground.</p>
                    <p>They eventually agreed to let me pay just the $450 I authorized. Saved me $750. Thank you to everyone who contributed here.</p>
