                    <p>I work at a warehouse in Los Angeles. Regular shift is 9 hours (8am-5pm). Management routinely denies meal breaks or tells us to "eat while you work" because we're short-staffed.</p>
                    <p>This has been going on for 8 months. I'd estimate I missed meal breaks about 3-4 days per week during that time.</p>
                    <p>I know California has strict meal break laws. What am I owed? How do I calculate it? And what's this PAGA thing I keep seeing mentioned?</p>

                    <p>California Labor Code Section 512 requires employers to provide a 30-minute meal break for shifts over 5 hours. For shifts over 10 hours, you're entitled to a second meal break.</p>
                    <p>When an employer fails to provide a compliant meal break, they owe you one additional hour of pay at your regular rate for EACH violation. This is called "premium pay."</p>
                    <p>So if you work $18/hour and missed a meal break, they owe you $18 for that day. This is in addition to your normal wages.</p>

                    <p>I make $19.50/hour. If I missed meal breaks 3 days/week for 32 weeks, that's like 96 violations?</p>
                    <p>96 violations × $19.50 = $1,872?</p>

                    <p>Your math is correct. Each missed meal break = 1 hour of premium pay at your regular rate.</p>
                    <p>Important: There's a 3-year statute of limitations for meal break claims. Document everything you can remember - dates, how long you worked, whether you got a meal break.</p>
                    <p>Do you have any records? Time cards, schedules, text messages from managers about working through lunch?</p>

                    <p>Re: PAGA - that's the Private Attorneys General Act. It allows employees to sue on behalf of the state for Labor Code violations.</p>
                    <p>Key differences between PAGA and individual claims:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Individual claim:</strong> You sue for your own missed meal breaks. You get 100% of your recovery.</li>
                        <li><strong>PAGA claim:</strong> You sue for violations affecting ALL employees. 75% goes to the state, 25% split among affected employees. BUT you can recover penalties beyond just premium pay.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>PAGA penalties for meal break violations are $100 per violation (first) and $200 per subsequent violation per employee. If your employer has 50 employees and is denying everyone meal breaks, the penalties add up fast.</p>

                    <p>Those Slack messages are gold. Screenshot everything NOW before they potentially delete it.</p>
                    <p>Given the systematic nature (80 employees, supervisor directing no breaks), this is a strong PAGA case. You should consult with an employment attorney who handles PAGA claims.</p>
                    <p>Process for PAGA:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Send notice to employer and California Labor & Workforce Development Agency (LWDA)</li>
                        <li>Wait 65 days for LWDA to investigate (they almost never do)</li>
                        <li>File lawsuit in superior court</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Most PAGA attorneys work on contingency (they take a percentage of recovery, no upfront cost to you).</p>

                    <p>Can't give specific referrals here, but look for firms that specialize in wage and hour class actions and PAGA. Many of the big plaintiffs' firms in LA do these cases.</p>
                    <p>Things to ask during consultations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have you handled PAGA meal break cases before?</li>
                        <li>What's your contingency percentage? (typically 33-40%)</li>
                        <li>How long do these cases typically take?</li>
                        <li>What's the risk if we lose? (should be none - contingency means no fee if no recovery)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Also be aware: once you file PAGA, retaliation protections kick in. They can't fire you for asserting your rights. But document everything going forward just in case.</p>

                    <p>Final update: Met with an employment attorney Friday. She's taking the case on contingency as a PAGA representative action.</p>
                    <p>She estimated based on 80 employees over 2 years, if even half had similar violations, we're looking at potential penalties in the $500K+ range. Obviously the state takes most of that but still significant for the class.</p>
                    <p>They're sending the PAGA notice letter this week. 65-day wait period starts then.</p>
                    <p>Thanks everyone for the guidance. Will update as this progresses.</p>

                    <p>Circling back to this thread with an update on California meal break law: the courts just issued a new ruling in November 2025 clarifying that employers can't use "voluntary waiver" agreements to circumvent meal break requirements for shifts over 6 hours.</p>
                    <p>Some employers were trying to have employees sign waivers saying "I choose to skip my meal break." The court ruled those waivers are invalid unless the shift is exactly 6 hours or less.</p>
                    <p>If anyone is being asked to sign meal break waivers for 8+ hour shifts, those are likely unenforceable. Don't let employers pressure you into signing away your rights.</p>
