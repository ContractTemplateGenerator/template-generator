                    <p>You have plenty of leverage - it's called a contract.</p>
                    <p>The copyright transfer happened because they fulfilled their payment obligation. That doesn't give them the right to demand money back. If anything, it strengthens your position because you both performed your contractual duties.</p>
                    <p>Here's what you should do:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Send a polite but firm response citing the contract</li>

                    <p>Had almost this exact thing happen with a web dev client last year. They approved everything, paid, then 3 weeks later wanted their money back because they "found a cheaper developer."</p>
                    <p>I sent them a professional email basically saying "our contract is fulfilled, payment is final." They threatened to dispute the charge with their credit card company.</p>
                    <p>I sent the contract + approval emails to the credit card company and won the dispute in like 48 hours. Client was out the money AND got hit with a chargeback fee from their bank.</p>

                    <p>If they leave a provably false review (claiming you didn't deliver, didn't meet the scope, etc.) you may have grounds for defamation. Most review platforms will also remove reviews that are factually inaccurate if you provide evidence.</p>
                    <p>Here's a template response you can send them:</p>
                    <p><em>"Thank you for your email. I understand you've had a change of direction. However, per our signed agreement dated [DATE], I delivered all items within the defined scope: [list deliverables]. You provided written approval on [DATE] stating [quote their approval]. Full payment was received on [DATE] and copyright was transferred as outlined in section [X] of our contract.</em></p>
                    <p><em>As the contract has been fully performed by both parties, I'm unable to offer a refund.

                    <p>Professional, factual, firm. Don't get emotional or defensive.</p>

                    <p>95% chance it's an empty threat. They'd have to:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Find a lawyer willing to take the case (unlikely given the facts)</li>
                        <li>Pay that lawyer several thousand dollars</li>
                        <li>Prove you breached the contract (impossible based on what you've described)</li>
                        <li>Risk paying YOUR legal fees if they lose</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>No rational lawyer would advise them to sue over this. They approved the work, paid for it, and got what they contracted for. They have no case.</p>
                    <p>If they do somehow send you a demand letter, don't ignore it, but also don't panic. You can respond yourself or hire a lawyer to respond for you (usually $300-500 for a simple response letter). Most demand letters are just intimidation tactics.</p>
                    <p>Keep all your documentation organized: contract, scope, approval emails, payment receipts, delivery confirmations. If you have that, you're in excellent shape.</p>

                    <p>Final update: Haven't heard from them in 2 days since I didn't respond to the lawyer threat. I think they realized they don't have a case.</p>
                    <p>Thanks everyone for talking me off the ledge. I was about to refund them just to make the problem go away but you all convinced me to stand firm. Lesson learned about adding clearer acceptance and refund terms to my contracts.</p>

                    <p>Bumping this old thread because I'm dealing with something similar. Client hired me for video production ($8,500), I delivered the final cut, they paid in full, then 3 weeks later they're demanding a refund saying "the video didn't perform as expected on social media."</p>
                    <p>My contract has no performance guarantees - I was hired to produce a video to their specifications, which I did. They're threatening to dispute the charge with their credit card company if I don't refund.</p>
                    <p>Can they actually do a chargeback after they've had the final deliverable for weeks? Seems like fraud to me but I don't know if credit card companies see it that way.</p>
