                    <p>I feel so stupid. Hired a contractor back in October for a kitchen renovation. Total job was $45K, he asked for $15K upfront for "materials and permits." Had good reviews on google, showed me his license, seemed professional.</p>
                    <p>He came by twice after I paid, did some demo work, then just... vanished. Won't answer calls, texts go unread, showed up at the address on his business card and its a UPS store mailbox. Its been 5 weeks.</p>
                    <p>I have the contract, cancelled check, and text messages. What are my options here? Can I actually get this money back or am I just screwed?</p>

                    <p>Sorry this happened to you. Unfortunately its more common than people realize. Here's your action plan:</p>
                    <p><strong>1. State Contractor Board Complaint (do this FIRST)</strong><br>
                    If he's licensed, file a complaint with your state's contractor licensing board immediately. This is often more effective than court because:
                    - Boards can suspend/revoke licenses
                    - Many states have contractor recovery funds for exactly this situation
                    - If he has a surety bond (required in most states), you can file a claim against it</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Small Claims Court</strong><br>
                    $15K is within small claims limits in most states. You don't need a lawyer. Bring your contract, proof of payment, all communications, photos of incomplete work. Even if he doesn't show up, you get a default judgment.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Police Report</strong><br>
                    File one. Taking money with no intent to perform the work is theft by deception in most jurisdictions. Police often say "its civil" but file anyway - it creates a paper trail and sometimes prosecutors do pursue these, especially if he's done it to others.</p>
                    <p><strong>4. Check for Other Victims</strong><br>
                    Search his name and company on local Facebook groups, Nextdoor, BBB complaints. If there's a pattern, a prosecutor is more likely to get involved and you might have grounds for a class action.</p>

                    <p>@ConstructionLawyer thank you for the detailed response. looked up his license and its showing as "active" on the state website. filed the complaint this morning and they said typical investigation takes 60-90 days. also filing police report today.</p>
                    <p>@other_victim sorry you went through it too. the violation is real - I keep second guessing myself like how did I not see this coming</p>

                    <p>If his license is active, thats actually good news for you. Means he has a bond you can potentially claim against, and the board has more leverage.</p>
                    <p>One more thing - check your homeowners insurance. Some policies have coverage for contractor fraud/theft. Long shot but worth a call.</p>
                    <p>And don't beat yourself up. These guys are professionals at this. Good reviews are easy to fake and they know exactly how to seem legitimate. The fact that you have a signed contract and documentation puts you in a better position than most.</p>
