                    <p>Posting this as a warning to others. My startup just got hit with an IRS audit for worker misclassification. We had 6 "contractors" who the IRS says should have been W-2 employees. Now we're looking at back taxes, penalties, and interest going back 3 years.</p>
                    <p>The total damage is looking like $180K+. We're a small company - this could sink us.</p>
                    <p>What triggers these audits? How do other companies structure this correctly? I thought as long as we used 1099s and they signed contractor agreements, we were fine.</p>

                    <p>Sorry to hear this. Unfortunately, signing a contractor agreement doesn't determine classification - the IRS looks at the actual working relationship. The three main factors they examine:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Behavioral Control:</strong> Do you control how/when/where they work? Set their hours? Require them to be in office?</li>
                        <li><strong>Financial Control:</strong> Do they have significant investment in their own equipment? Can they profit or lose money? Work for other clients?</li>
                        <li><strong>Relationship Type:</strong> Are they integral to your business? Do they get benefits? Is the relationship ongoing with no defined end?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If most answers favor "employee," a contract saying "contractor" won't save you.</p>

                    <p>Common audit triggers I've seen:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A contractor files for unemployment after you end the relationship</li>

                        <li>State agency (EDD in California, etc.) flags you during routine audit</li>
                        <li>1099 amounts look suspiciously like salary (same amount every 2 weeks, year after year)</li>
                        <li>Whistleblower complaint from current/former worker</li>

                    <p>Yeah, one of the contractors we let go filed for unemployment. California EDD denied it initially, but then they opened an investigation into our company. That's what triggered the whole thing.</p>
                    <p>The EDD audit led to an IRS referral. Now we're dealing with both state and federal issues.</p>

                    <p>California is brutal for this, especially after AB5 passed. The ABC test there is much stricter than the federal standard.</p>
                    <p>Under AB5, a worker is an employee UNLESS:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>A:</strong> Free from control and direction in performing work</li>
                        <li><strong>B:</strong> Performs work outside the usual course of your business</li>
                        <li><strong>C:</strong> Engaged in an independently established trade/business of that nature</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That "B" prong kills most tech companies. If you're a software company and you hire a "contractor" to write software... they're doing work in your usual course of business. That alone makes them an employee under California law.</p>

                    <p>Let me break down the potential penalties since I don't think people realize how serious this is:</p>
                    <p><strong>IRS Penalties for Misclassification:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>100% of employee's share of FICA that should have been withheld</li>
                        <li>Employer's share of FICA (7.65%)</li>
                        <li>Federal income tax withholding (can use safe harbor of 1.5% of wages)</li>
                        <li>Interest on all back amounts</li>
                        <li>Potential 20% negligence penalty or 75% fraud penalty</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>State Penalties (California as example):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Back unemployment insurance taxes + penalties</li>
                        <li>State disability insurance</li>
                        <li>Workers' comp violations (big deal if someone got injured)</li>
                        <li>Labor code violations - unpaid overtime, missed meal breaks, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Plus the workers themselves can sue for benefits they should have received. This is why $180K is unfortunately realistic for 6 workers over 3 years.</p>

                    <p>We went through something similar 2 years ago. Here's what we did differently after:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Any long-term work (3+ months) = employee, period</li>
                        <li>Contractors must have their own LLC or Corp, own equipment, own liability insurance</li>
                        <li>Contractors work on defined projects with deliverables, not ongoing "help out with whatever"</li>
                        <li>Never require specific hours or on-site work</li>
                        <li>They MUST have other clients (we ask for proof)</li>

                    <p>@NewbiePM - Using a staffing agency does help because they're the employer of record. The agency handles W-2s, payroll taxes, workers comp, etc.</p>
                    <p>BUT there are still risks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Joint employer liability if you exercise too much control</li>
                        <li>If the agency goes bankrupt or doesn't pay taxes, you could be on the hook</li>
                        <li>Some agencies misclassify their OWN workers and you could get caught up in their audit</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Due diligence on the agency matters. Make sure they're legit, established, and properly insured.</p>

                    <p>Update for anyone following: Our tax attorney is exploring the Section 530 safe harbor defense. Apparently if you have a "reasonable basis" for treating workers as contractors (like industry practice or prior IRS audit that didn't reclassify), you might reduce penalties.</p>
                    <p>Also looking into the Voluntary Classification Settlement Program (VCSP) - you can come forward and reclassify workers going forward in exchange for reduced penalties on past years. Wish we'd known about this before the audit started.</p>

                    <p>Good move on VCSP - that's exactly what it's designed for. For others reading this thread:</p>
                    <p><strong>Voluntary Classification Settlement Program (VCSP):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Must not currently be under audit</li>
                        <li>Must have consistently treated workers as contractors</li>
                        <li>Must have filed all required 1099s for the past 3 years</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you qualify, you pay about 10% of the employment tax liability for one year, no interest/penalties, and no audit for prior years. It's a great deal if you realize you've been misclassifying.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately once an audit starts, you can't use VCSP. That's why proactive compliance review is worth the cost.</p>

                    <p>I'm on the other side of this - I'm a legit contractor (own LLC, multiple clients, my own equipment) but I'm always worried clients will try to treat me like an employee.</p>
                    <p>Red flags I watch for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client wants me to use their email domain</li>
                        <li>Required to attend all-hands meetings</li>
                        <li>Being told when to work, not just deadlines</li>
                        <li>Being restricted from working with other clients</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If I see these, I push back. Not only for the client's protection but for mine - if they get audited and I get reclassified, it messes up MY taxes too.</p>
