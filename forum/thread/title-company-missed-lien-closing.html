                    <p>I bought a house in Florida in June 2025. We used a title company recommended by our realtor, paid for title insurance, everything seemed fine. Closed on June 15th, got the keys, life is good.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday I get served with a lawsuit from a roofing contractor claiming the previous owner owes them $40,000 for work done in March 2025. They filed a mechanic's lien on April 2, 2025 - TWO MONTHS before I bought the place.</p>
                    <p>The title company's search completely missed it. Now this contractor is saying they're going to foreclose on MY house to collect the debt. I'm freaking out. What do I do?</p>

                    <p>This is exactly what title insurance is for. The title company missed the lien in their search, which means they have a duty to defend you and pay the claim.</p>
                    <p>Steps you need to take immediately:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Contact the title company and file a claim on your title insurance policy</li>
                        <li>Send them a copy of the lawsuit you received</li>
                        <li>Demand they provide you with legal defense</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Don't wait. You have 20 days to respond to the lawsuit. If you miss that deadline, they can get a default judgment against you.</p>
                    <p>Here's what you do:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Email the title company TODAY with the lawsuit attached</li>
                        <li>In the email, explicitly state you are making a claim under your title insurance policy</li>
                        <li>Request they assign counsel to defend you within 5 business days</li>
                        <li>If they don't respond in 3 days, hire your own attorney and bill the title company</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You have rights under the insurance policy. They can't just slow-roll you.</p>

                    <p>I went through something similar in Georgia. Title company missed a tax lien. They eventually paid it, but they tried to claim it was an "excluded item" in the policy. Read your title insurance policy CAREFULLY to see what's covered.</p>
                    <p>In my case, I had to get a lawyer to threaten them before they paid up. Cost me $3,500 in legal fees but they eventually reimbursed me for that too.</p>

                    <p>The lien was filed April 2, my policy date is June 15, so this should definitely be covered, right?</p>

                    <p>Yes, 100% covered. A mechanic's lien filed two months before your policy date is exactly the type of defect title insurance protects against.</p>
                    <p>The title company screwed up - they should have found this in their title search before closing. Now they're on the hook for:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The full $40,000 lien amount</li>

                    <p>Florida attorney here. Mechanic's liens in Florida are serious - they attach to the property, not the owner. So even though you didn't hire the contractor, the lien follows the property.</p>
                    <p>However, you're protected because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Title insurance covers this exact scenario</li>
                        <li>The title company had a duty to discover all liens</li>
                        <li>You relied on their title search</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Also, you might have a claim against the seller for failing to disclose the lien at closing. Did your purchase agreement have any representations about liens or encumbrances?</p>

                    <p>Estate sales can be tricky, but the representation is still binding. The estate had a duty to disclose all known liens.</p>
                    <p>That said, your primary path here is the title insurance claim. Let the title company deal with it - that's literally what you paid for. If they try to deny coverage or drag their feet, then you look at suing them for breach of the insurance contract.</p>
                    <p>Bottom line: File the claim, demand defense counsel, and let the professionals handle it. Don't panic.</p>

                    <p>They also said they'll work with the contractor to settle the lien. Sounds like they're going to just pay it to make it go away.</p>
