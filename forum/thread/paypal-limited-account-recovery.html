                    <p>Running a dropshipping business for about a year. PayPal was my only payment processor (stupid, I know now). Yesterday got the dreaded "Your account has been permanently limited" email.</p>
                    <p>They're holding $27,412 for 180 DAYS. That's essentially my entire operating capital. I have suppliers to pay and orders to fulfill. This is going to destroy my business.</p>
                    <p>The email says I violated their Acceptable Use Policy but doesn't say what I did. I sell home goods - nothing remotely prohibited. Zero chargebacks, 4.8 star seller rating.</p>
                    <p>What are my realistic options here? Is there any way to speed up getting my money? Or am I just screwed for 6 months?</p>

                    <p>Same thing happened to me last year with $19K. Let me tell you what I learned the hard way:</p>
                    <p>The 180 days is mostly non-negotiable BUT you can sometimes get a partial release. File a CFPB complaint immediately - PayPal has to respond within 15 days and it gets escalated to a real person.</p>
                    <p>Also email executiveoffice@paypal.com with your full documentation. Sometimes the executive team can authorize early partial releases.</p>

                    <p>Dropshipping triggers PayPal's algorithm constantly. The longer shipping times from overseas suppliers look like delivery failures to them. Even if customers are happy, PayPal sees 14-21 day delivery windows and panics.</p>
                    <p>Did you recently have a spike in volume? That's usually what tips it over.</p>

                    <p>@DropshipDan Yes actually - had a really good Black Friday. Did about $12K in 4 days which was way above my normal $3-4K/week. That must have triggered it.</p>

                    <p>Here's the documentation checklist for your CFPB complaint and executive escalation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Business registration/LLC documents</li>
                        <li>Tax returns or bank statements showing legitimate business</li>
                        <li>Supplier invoices proving you have real inventory/orders</li>
                        <li>Tracking numbers for all pending orders</li>
                        <li>Screenshots of positive customer reviews</li>
                        <li>Your complete transaction history showing low dispute rate</li>
                        <li>Any correspondence with PayPal</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For the CFPB complaint, be specific about the harm: "PayPal is holding $27,412 of my funds without specific explanation of policy violation. This is preventing me from fulfilling customer orders and paying suppliers, causing business harm."</p>
                    <p>If you're in California, New York, or other states with strong consumer protection, mention you're considering small claims court. PayPal's arbitration clause has carve-outs for small claims in some states.</p>
                    <p>We have a demand letter template at <a href="/Demand-Letters/Platforms/paypal-funds-demand-letter.html">/Demand-Letters/Platforms/</a> that covers the key points.</p>

                    <p>While you're fighting to get your funds back, you need to set up alternatives ASAP or your business is dead anyway:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> Easy to set up, but can also freeze (less common though)</li>
                        <li><strong>Square:</strong> Good for some businesses, but they also have sudden terminations</li>
                        <li><strong>Shopify Payments:</strong> If you're on Shopify already, use this</li>
                        <li><strong>Traditional merchant account:</strong> Takes longer to approve but way more stable. Look at Helcim, Stax, or a local bank</li>

                    <p>Honestly for dropshipping specifically you might want to look at processors that cater to ecommerce - they understand the model better and won't freak out about delivery times.</p>

                    <p>Jumping in because I actually won in small claims against PayPal in California last year. They held $8K for 180 days, I sued for the funds plus damages for business interruption.</p>
                    <p>PayPal's arbitration clause specifically excludes small claims court. Filed in my county, they sent a lawyer, judge ruled in my favor. Got my money plus $2K in damages.</p>
                    <p>Downside: takes time and you need to be in a state where small claims limits cover your amount. California is $12,500 max so your $27K wouldn't fit. But worth looking into if you're under the limit.</p>

                    <p>Update for anyone finding this later:</p>
                    <p>Filed CFPB complaint on Dec 3. Got a call from PayPal "Office of Executive Escalations" on Dec 8. They reviewed my documentation and agreed to release 50% ($13,700) immediately. The remaining $13,700 is on a 90-day hold instead of 180.</p>
                    <p>Not perfect but I can at least pay my suppliers and keep the business running. The CFPB complaint definitely got their attention - regular support was useless.</p>
                    <p>Already set up Stripe and Shopify Payments as alternatives. Never putting all eggs in one basket again.</p>
