                    <p>One of our best engineers just asked if he can work remotely from Austin for 6 months while his partner does a fellowship there. We're a 15-person startup incorporated in Delaware, office in NYC.</p>
                    <p>Our lawyer is saying this creates a "nexus" in Texas and we'd need to register as a foreign entity, get workers' comp insurance there, withhold Texas taxes, etc. This seems insane for one person working remotely for 6 months.</p>
                    <p>Is this really that complicated or is our lawyer being overly cautious? What do other startups do?</p>

                    <p>Your lawyer is not being overly cautious. This is a real compliance issue. The main concerns:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Foreign entity registration in Texas (required if employee is there long-term)</li>

                    <p>Employment lawyer here who deals with this constantly. Your lawyer is correct, but the level of urgency depends on a few factors:</p>
                    <p>Texas doesn't have a bright-line rule for "temporary" vs. "permanent" remote work, but 6 months is long enough that I'd recommend treating it as establishing presence. Here's what you actually need to do:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Foreign entity registration:</strong> Register to do business in Texas. One-time $750 fee + annual franchise tax report</li>
                        <li><strong>Tax withholding:</strong> Register with Texas Comptroller. Note: Texas has no state income tax, so this is actually simpler than NY</li>
                        <li><strong>Unemployment insurance:</strong> Register with Texas Workforce Commission</li>
                        <li><strong>Workers' comp:</strong> Get a Texas policy or rider on your existing policy</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Total setup cost is probably $2K-3K including your lawyer's fees. Not nothing, but not crazy either.</p>

                    <p>That's helpful, thanks. What if we just... don't tell Texas? Like, he keeps his NY address on file and files NY taxes? Is that a thing companies do?</p>

                    <p>I can't recommend that. Here's why it's risky:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If he gets injured on the job in Texas, you don't have TX workers' comp coverage. That's a big liability.</li>
                        <li>If Texas discovers you have an employee there without registration, they can impose penalties and demand back taxes/fees.</li>
                        <li>Your employee is committing tax fraud by claiming NY residency while living in TX.</li>
                        <li>If you ever get audited or go through due diligence for fundraising/acquisition, this becomes a disclosed liability.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Companies do this all the time, yes. But it's playing with fire. The question is whether saving $3K is worth the risk of a much larger problem later.</p>

                    <p>From a VC diligence perspective: we see this issue constantly and it's a red flag if companies haven't properly registered in states where they have employees. Not a deal-killer, but it has to be cleaned up pre-closing.</p>
                    <p>We had one portfolio company that had 3 remote employees and hadn't registered in any of their states. Cost them about $15K total to clean up retroactively, plus penalties. Just do it right from the start.</p>

                    <p>We use Deel for exactly this reason. They handle all the compliance, registration, and payroll for remote employees in different states. It's like $50/month per employee.</p>
                    <p>Way easier than trying to figure this out yourself, especially if you plan to hire more remote people in the future.</p>

                    <p>It's state-specific. Some general guidelines:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Less than 30 days: Generally safe to treat as business travel</li>
                        <li>30-60 days: Gray area, but probably okay if it's truly temporary</li>
                        <li>60-90 days: Should probably start compliance process</li>
                        <li>90+ days: Definitely need to be compliant</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These aren't hard rules though. California, for example, is extremely aggressive and will claim nexus even for short-term remote work.</p>
                    <p>The safest approach: if someone is working remotely from another state for more than 30 days, get compliant.</p>

                    <p>Also keep in mind that Texas has franchise tax which is basically a gross receipts tax. If you register there, you'll need to file an annual franchise tax report even if you owe $0.</p>
                    <p>It's not a huge burden but it's one more compliance thing to track. We have employees in 8 states now and the administrative overhead is real.</p>
