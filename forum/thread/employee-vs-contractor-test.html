                    <p>Got offered a software dev position at a startup. Pay is good ($85/hr) but they sent me a 1099 contractor agreement instead of W-2.</p>
                    <p>The weird part: they're requiring me to work in their office Mon-Fri, 9-5. They also want me to use their equipment and attend all team meetings. They even have a clause saying I can't work for anyone else during "business hours."</p>
                    <p>Is this legit? I thought contractors were supposed to have flexibility on when/where they work. This feels like an employee job but without the benefits.</p>

                    <p>Red flags everywhere. This is textbook misclassification. They want you to be an employee but don't want to pay employer taxes, provide benefits, or follow employment laws.</p>
                    <p>Don't sign this. They're exposing themselves to massive liability and you're the one who gets screwed.</p>

                    <p>This is almost certainly misclassification under both IRS rules and the Department of Labor standards. The key test is behavioral control, financial control, and relationship type.</p>
                    <p>Based on what you described:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Behavioral control:</strong> They control when and where you work = employee factor</li>
                        <li><strong>Required to use their equipment:</strong> employee factor</li>
                        <li><strong>Set hours (9-5):</strong> employee factor</li>
                        <li><strong>Can't work for others:</strong> employee factor</li>
                        <li><strong>Must attend meetings:</strong> employee factor</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Everything points to employee status. The fact they're calling you a contractor doesn't make it legal.</p>

                    <p>That $85/hr looks more like $60/hr after taxes and missed benefits. Compare that to your W-2 offers.</p>

                    <p>Also you lose all employee protections:</p>

                        <li>No minimum wage protection</li>

                    <p>If the IRS or DOL audits them and determines you were misclassified, you could file Form SS-8 to get reclassified. Then you'd be entitled to back benefits, but it would likely end your relationship with the company.</p>

                    <p>To make it a legitimate contractor relationship, you'd need to negotiate:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Control your own hours:</strong> Work when and where you want, as long as deliverables are met</li>
                        <li><strong>Use your own equipment:</strong> Your laptop, software, workspace</li>
                        <li><strong>Project-based work:</strong> Specific deliverables with defined scope, not ongoing employment</li>
                        <li><strong>Ability to work for others:</strong> No exclusivity clause</li>
                        <li><strong>Set your own methods:</strong> They define what needs to be done, you decide how</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>But honestly? Startups want employees. They want someone they can manage and direct. Sounds like they want an employee but don't want to pay the costs. I'd push for W-2.</p>

                    <p>I was in this exact situation 2 years ago. Company wanted 1099, required office presence, etc. I pushed back and said "Based on the IRS common law test, this role is clearly employee classification. I'm happy to work under those terms as a W-2 employee."</p>
                    <p>They came back 2 days later with a W-2 offer at $120k salary plus benefits. Turns out their "finance person" (read: inexperienced founder) thought 1099 was just easier. They didn't realize they were breaking the law.</p>
                    <p>Stand your ground. Most startups will convert to W-2 if you explain the legal risks.</p>

                    <p>Update: Sent them an email explaining the IRS behavioral control test and how the arrangement they described wouldn't qualify as independent contractor status. Mentioned the potential penalties for misclassification.</p>

                    <p>For your negotiation: the employer's cost for a W-2 employee is roughly 1.25x to 1.4x the base salary (factoring in payroll taxes, benefits, insurance, etc.).</p>
                    <p>So if they were willing to pay $85/hr as 1099 ($177k annualized), they should be able to offer around $125-140k base salary plus benefits. Don't let them lowball you significantly below that range.</p>

                    <p>Final update: Settled on $130k salary as W-2 with health insurance, 401k (no match though, startup life), and 15 days PTO. Also got equity (0.25%).</p>
                    <p>Way better than being on the hook for self-employment tax and having zero protections. Start on July 1st. Thanks everyone for talking sense into me.</p>

                    <p>Super helpful thread. I'm in a nearly identical situation - startup wants to bring me on as 1099 for a "full-time engineering role." They're requiring 9am-5pm in-office, using their equipment, working on their roadmap with no ability to take other clients.</p>
                    <p>After reading this thread I pushed back and they got defensive saying "this is standard in startups" and that W-2 is "too expensive for us right now." Red flag city.</p>
                    <p>Going to pass on this opportunity. If they can't afford to properly classify employees, they're not a company I want to tie my career to. Thanks for all the detailed explanations in this thread - really clarified the legal issues for me.</p>
