                    <p>I rent an apartment in Austin, Texas. My landlord has entered without notice three times in the past month. I know because I have a Ring camera inside.</p>
                    <p>The first time I thought maybe it was an emergency. But looking at the footage, he just walked around, looked in my closets, and left. No repairs, nothing broken. The other two times were the same - he just seems to be "checking on things."</p>
                    <p>I've asked him to stop and he said it's "his property" and he can enter whenever he wants. I checked my lease and it says he needs to give 24 hours notice except for emergencies, but he's ignoring that.</p>
                    <p>What are my rights here? This feels like a massive invasion of privacy. Can I change the locks? Withhold rent? I really don't want to move but this is creepy.</p>

                    <p>This is a violation of your lease and your rights. Document everything. Save all the Ring footage.</p>
                    <p>In Texas, if your lease says 24 hours notice, he has to follow it. That's a binding contract. The "it's my property" excuse doesn't fly.</p>
                    <p>Don't change the locks without permission - that could put you in breach of the lease. And definitely don't withhold rent, that's a good way to get evicted.</p>

                    <p>Real estate attorney in Texas here. This is a clear violation of both your lease and Texas law.</p>
                    <p><strong>Texas law on landlord entry:</strong> Texas Property Code Section 92.0081 requires landlords to give reasonable notice before entering, unless it's an emergency. Your lease specifies 24 hours, which is the standard.</p>
                    <p><strong>What your landlord is doing is illegal.</strong> Walking around and looking in closets is not an emergency. This is a breach of your right to "quiet enjoyment" of the property.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your remedies under Texas law:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Written notice:</strong> Send a formal written notice (certified mail) citing the lease provision and demanding he stop unauthorized entries</li>
                        <li><strong>Actual damages:</strong> You can sue for damages. While hard to quantify privacy violations, the repeated nature supports a claim</li>
                        <li><strong>Injunctive relief:</strong> You can seek a court order prohibiting unauthorized entry</li>
                        <li><strong>Lease termination:</strong> Under Sec. 92.0563, repeated violations may give you grounds to terminate early without penalty</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>What NOT to do:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't change locks without written permission (lease breach)</li>
                        <li>Don't withhold rent (creates separate legal issues)</li>
                        <li>Don't set up booby traps or attempt self-help remedies</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Thanks for the detailed response. I definitely won't change the locks or withhold rent.</p>
                    <p>What should I include in the formal written notice? And if he ignores it and keeps entering, what's my next step? Do I really have to sue him? That seems expensive and I'm just trying to live in peace.</p>
                    <p>Also - is it legal for me to have the Ring camera inside the apartment? He hasn't said anything about it but I'm worried he might claim I violated something.</p>

                    <p><strong>On the written notice:</strong> Include these elements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reference to your lease (copy the relevant section about 24-hour notice)</li>
                        <li>Specific dates/times of unauthorized entries with brief description</li>
                        <li>Clear statement that these entries violate the lease and Texas Property Code 92.0081</li>
                        <li>Demand for immediate cessation of unauthorized entries</li>
                        <li>Statement that you will pursue legal remedies if it continues</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>On the camera:</strong> Generally legal in Texas. You have a reasonable expectation of privacy in your own apartment. The landlord enters at his own risk. Just make sure it's not in a bathroom or anywhere else that might record guests in private situations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Next steps if he continues:</strong> Before going straight to lawsuit, consider:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>File a complaint with local code enforcement or housing authority</li>
                        <li>Report to the Texas Real Estate Commission if he's a licensed property manager</li>
                        <li>Small claims court for damages (max $20,000 in Texas) - cheaper than district court</li>
                        <li>Contact legal aid or tenant advocacy groups in Austin - many offer free consultations</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The written notice often solves it because landlords don't want legal trouble. The camera footage is powerful evidence.</p>

                    <p>I had something similar happen in a different city. My landlord was entering to "show the apartment" to prospective tenants even though my lease wasn't up for 6 months.</p>
                    <p>I sent a certified letter citing the lease and state law. He stopped immediately. I think most landlords back down when they realize the tenant knows their rights and has documentation.</p>

                    <p>Good job on the letter and documentation. Keep a log going forward of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any further unauthorized entries (date, time, duration)</li>
                        <li>Any communications with the landlord about this issue</li>
                        <li>Any retaliation attempts (rent increases, bogus lease violations, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Texas law prohibits landlord retaliation (Sec. 92.331) so if he tries anything punitive after your letter, that's another violation.</p>
                    <p>Hopefully he backs off. Most do when confronted with evidence and legal knowledge.</p>

                    <p>Final update: He responded via email (after signing for the letter) and apologized. Said he was "just checking on maintenance issues" but acknowledges he should have given notice.</p>
                    <p>He agreed in writing (I made sure to get this in email) that he will provide 24 hours written notice before any future entries unless there's a genuine emergency.</p>
                    <p>No entries since I sent the letter (it's been almost a week). Ring camera is staying up.</p>
                    <p>Thanks everyone for the advice - knowing my rights and having evidence made all the difference.</p>

                    <p>Great outcome! Save that email - it's an admission and a new agreement. If he violates it again, you have even stronger grounds.</p>
                    <p>Glad you stood up for your rights. More tenants need to do this.</p>
