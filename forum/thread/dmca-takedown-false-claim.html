This includes lost revenue, attorney fees, and other costs.

                    <p>I am absolutely FUMING right now. One of my most popular videos just got taken down via DMCA. The kicker? The "original content" they claim I stole doesn't even exist. I made this video from scratch - I have the raw footage, project files, everything.</p>
                    <p>Looked up the claimant - it's a shell company that I'm 99% sure is connected to a competitor who's been copying MY content for months. They filed the claim on something I posted 8 months ago and NOW it's suddenly infringement?</p>
                    <p>This is so obviously abuse of the system. What are my options here? Can I sue them for filing a false claim?</p>

                    <p>Take a breath. This is infuriating but you have options.</p>
                    <p><strong>Immediate step: File a DMCA counter-notification.</strong> The counter-notice must include:</p>
                    <p>1. Identification of the removed material and its location before removal<br>
                    2. Statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief the material was removed by mistake<br>
                    3. Your name, address, phone number<br>
                    4. Consent to jurisdiction of federal district court<br>
                    5. Your physical or electronic signature</p>
                    <p>Once you file, the platform must restore your content within 10-14 business days UNLESS the claimant files an actual lawsuit. Most fraudulent claimants won't go that far because they'd have to commit perjury in federal court.</p>
                    <p><strong>Regarding suing them:</strong> Yes, 17 U.S.C. 512(f) allows you to sue for damages if someone "knowingly materially misrepresents" that content is infringing. The catch: you need to prove they KNEW the claim was false, not just that they were wrong. If you can connect them to your competitor and show bad faith, you have a case.</p>

                    <p>Been there, fought that, won.</p>
                    <p>Similar situation last year - competitor filed DMCA on 3 of my videos using a random LLC. I filed counter-notices on all of them. They didn't sue (obviously, because they had nothing). Content restored in 12 days.</p>
                    <p>Then I went on offense. Hired an attorney, sent them a demand letter citing 512(f), and they settled for $15k to make it go away. Not huge money but covered my legal fees and sent a message.</p>
                    <p>Key thing that helped: I had EVERYTHING documented. Original project files with metadata showing creation dates, Dropbox revision history, even slack messages discussing the video while I was making it. Gather all that now.</p>

                    <p>Former trust & safety at a major platform here. Let me explain how this works from the inside:</p>
                    <p>Platforms HAVE to act on DMCA notices quickly to maintain safe harbor protection. We can't investigate whether a claim is legit before taking content down - that's the law working as designed (poorly, imo).</p>
                    <p>But we DO track patterns. If someone files multiple bogus claims that get counter-noticed, they get flagged. Repeat abusers can lose their ability to file claims or have their account terminated entirely.</p>
                    <p>When you file your counter-notice, be thorough. Include a summary of evidence you have. We can't make legal determinations but we do note when counter-notices are well-documented vs. just "nuh uh wasn't me."</p>

                    <p>Thanks everyone. Just filed the counter-notification. Included timestamps from my project files, Wayback Machine link showing my video was up 6 months before their supposed "original," and screenshots of the competitor's channel that's been ripping off my style.</p>
                    <p>Still so frustrating that they can just... do this. Zero consequence for wasting my time and potentially hurting my channel during the holidays when viewership spikes.</p>

                    <p>pro tip for everyone reading this: start documenting your creation process NOW before you need it</p>
                    <p>I use a combo of: 1) git commits for any code/scripts, 2) raw footage backups with original timestamps, 3) periodic screenshots of my editing timeline, 4) a quick voice memo when I start a new project saying "starting work on X video about Y topic on [date]"</p>
                    <p>Sounds paranoid but when someone comes at you with a bogus claim, having ironclad proof of creation makes everything easier. The counter-notice is way more convincing and if you do need to sue for 512(f) damages you've already got your evidence ready</p>

                    <p>@creator_under_attack Good - you're doing everything right. A few more thoughts:</p>
                    <p>1. Keep records of any revenue loss during the takedown period. If you pursue 512(f), actual damages matter.</p>
                    <p>2. If you can establish that shell company is connected to your competitor (same address, shared ownership, etc.), that strengthens bad faith argument significantly.</p>
                    <p>3. Consider whether this is worth pursuing beyond just getting content restored. Legal costs add up, but sometimes a strong demand letter ($500-1500 from an attorney) is enough to make them think twice about doing it again.</p>
                    <p>The DMCA system is broken and gets abused constantly, but the tools to fight back do exist. Keep us posted.</p>
