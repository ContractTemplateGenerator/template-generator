                    <p>Good move calling Honda corporate. The field engineer inspection is critical - they're usually more objective than the dealer techs.</p>
                    <p>A few tips for the inspection:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be present when the engineer inspects the car if possible</li>
                        <li>Ask questions and take notes</li>
                        <li>Request a copy of the inspection report in writing</li>
                        <li>If they deny the claim, ask for the specific reason in writing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If Honda denies the warranty claim, you may want to consult a lemon law attorney. Many work on contingency in CA.</p>

                    <p>Update: Honda field engineer came out yesterday (Sep 2). He inspected the transmission for about an hour, pulled diagnostic codes, checked fluid levels and condition.</p>
                    <p>He agreed with me - no signs of abuse. He found metal shavings in the transmission fluid which he said indicates a manufacturing defect in the CVT belt or bearings. Honda is authorizing the warranty repair.</p>
                    <p>Dealership is now suddenly being super nice and apologetic. They're replacing the transmission at no cost and giving me a loaner car.</p>

                    <p>Great outcome! Make sure you get:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Written documentation that this was a warranty repair</li>
                        <li>Copy of the field engineer's report showing manufacturing defect</li>
                        <li>All repair orders and invoices showing $0 customer cost</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Keep all this documentation. If the transmission fails again within a reasonable time, you'll have a strong lemon law claim for a buyback or replacement vehicle.</p>

                    <p>Final update: Got the car back today with new transmission. Everything seems to be working fine now.</p>
                    <p>Lesson learned: don't take no for an answer when you know you're right. If I'd accepted the dealer's initial denial, I'd be out $6,500. Going straight to the manufacturer was the key.</p>
                    <p>Thanks everyone for the advice and encouragement to fight this!</p>

                    <p>This thread gives me hope. I'm dealing with a similar issue - bought a 2025 Silverado in June, engine light came on at 3,500 miles, dealership is claiming it's "normal operation" and refusing to diagnose it properly under warranty.</p>
                    <p>I'm in Texas so not sure if lemon law applies the same way. Did anyone here successfully use lemon law for an issue caught this early in ownership? The truck is barely 5 months old.</p>
                    <p>Based on the advice here I'm going to escalate to GM corporate tomorrow and document everything in writing.</p>
