                    <p>We just got our first Series A term sheet and I'm trying to figure out if the terms are standard or if we're being taken advantage of.</p>
                    <p>Background: B2B SaaS company, $2.1M ARR, grew from $400K last year. Profitable on a contribution margin basis but burning about $50K/month on growth initiatives. Three cofounders currently own 75% (I have 35%, other two have 20% each). Early angel investors and advisors own the remaining 25%.</p>
                    <p>The term sheet:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>$8M investment at a $32M pre-money valuation</li>
                        <li>20% of post-money ($40M post)</li>
                        <li>But they're asking for a 15% option pool increase BEFORE the investment</li>
                        <li>Full ratchet anti-dilution protection</li>
                        <li>2x liquidation preference, participating preferred</li>
                        <li>Lead gets a board seat + observer rights for another partner</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When I do the math with the new option pool, my ownership drops from 35% to like 26%. That's a 25% dilution which seems really high for a first institutional round?</p>
                    <p>Also not sure about the "participating preferred" thing. My lawyer mentioned it's aggressive but I don't fully understand the implications. Can someone explain in plain English?</p>

                    <p>That participating preferred is a huge red flag. Let me explain what it means:</p>
                    <p>Normal preferred stock: Investors choose between getting their money back (liquidation preference) OR their percentage ownership in an exit. They pick whichever is higher.</p>
                    <p>Participating preferred: They get their money back FIRST, THEN they also get their percentage of what's left. They get paid twice.</p>
                    <p>Example: If you sell for $50M with 2x participating preferred on $8M:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They get $16M off the top (2x their $8M)</li>
                        <li>Then they get 20% of the remaining $34M = $6.8M more</li>
                        <li>Total to investors: $22.8M out of $50M sale (45% of proceeds on 20% ownership)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You getting absolutely crushed on modest exits. This structure was common in 2009 but is mostly dead now except for struggling companies.</p>

                    <p>The full ratchet anti-dilution is also really aggressive. Most term sheets use weighted average anti-dilution which is way more founder-friendly.</p>
                    <p>Full ratchet means if you ever raise money at a lower valuation (down round), their shares get repriced to the new lower price. Basically transferring ownership from founders to early investors.</p>
                    <p>At your metrics ($2M ARR, profitable unit economics, good growth), you should be getting much better terms. Are you talking to multiple VCs or is this your only option?</p>

                    <p>We have two other firms interested but they're both earlier stage investors (late seed/pre-A) and couldn't write the full $8M check. This is the only term sheet we have in hand right now.</p>
                    <p>Our lawyer said the participating preferred is "non-market" and we should push back hard. But I'm worried about offending them and losing the deal. We have about 4 months of runway left and really need this capital.</p>

                    <p>Startup attorney here. Your lawyer is correct - this term sheet has multiple non-market terms for a healthy Series A. Let me break down what's standard vs. aggressive:</p>
                    <p><strong>Market terms for your stage:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1x liquidation preference, non-participating (standard for 95% of deals)</li>
                        <li>Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution (not full ratchet)</li>
                        <li>Pro rata rights for future rounds</li>
                        <li>One board seat for the lead investor</li>
                        <li>Standard protective provisions (approval rights on major decisions)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Aggressive terms in your sheet:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2x participating preferred (extremely aggressive, usually only seen in distressed financings)</li>
                        <li>Full ratchet anti-dilution (punitive, non-standard)</li>
                        <li>15% option pool increase (depends on your hiring plans, but forcing it pre-money increases their ownership at your expense)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The 25% dilution itself isn't crazy for a Series A, but the structure underneath is problematic. You should absolutely negotiate these terms.</p>

                    <p>I accepted similar terms in 2019 when I was desperate for capital. Biggest mistake of my fundraising career.</p>
                    <p>We sold the company 2 years later for $45M (which I thought was amazing). After the participating preferred math, investors got $28M and founders/employees split $17M. I personally walked away with $4.2M on a $45M exit after working 5 years and owning 22% of the company.</p>
                    <p>If it had been standard 1x non-participating preferred, I would have made $9.9M instead. The participating preferred cost me $5.7M.</p>
                    <p>Don't make my mistake. Counter-propose aggressively or walk away if you can.</p>

                    <p>I'm going to push back on the participating preferred and full ratchet. What should I counter with specifically? Just "1x non-participating and broad-based weighted average"?</p>

                    <p>Here's how I'd approach the negotiation:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Change participating preferred to non-participating. This is the most important point. If they won't budge here, seriously consider walking away.</li>
                        <li>Change full ratchet to broad-based weighted average. Explain you need downside protection flexibility for future rounds.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Negotiable items:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Liquidation preference: Offer to keep 2x if they make it non-participating. Or push for 1.5x as a compromise. But never accept 2x AND participating.</li>
                        <li>Option pool: Show them your actual hiring plan. If you don't need 15% for hires in the next 18 months, negotiate it down to 10% or make it post-money.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If they refuse to move on the participating preferred, that's a massive red flag about the partnership. Good VCs understand founder alignment matters for long-term success.</p>

                    <p>At $2.1M ARR with strong growth and profitability, you should be getting clean, founder-friendly terms. The terms you described are what we'd offer to a struggling company with 6 months of runway and no other options.</p>
                    <p>Some questions to consider:</p>

                        <li>Could you become default-alive (profitable) if you had to?</li>

                    <p>If you have negotiating leverage, use it. If you don't, creating it (even through getting profitable for 6 months) is worth delaying the round.</p>

                    <p>This has been incredibly helpful. I talked to my cofounders and our lawyer over the weekend. Here's our plan:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We're going to reach out to 5 more VCs this week to create competition and potentially get another term sheet</li>
                        <li>We're submitting a counter-proposal to the existing VC: 1x non-participating preferred, broad-based weighted average anti-dilution, 12% option pool (we can justify this with our hiring plan)</li>
                        <li>If they refuse to move on participating preferred, we're going to walk away and either raise a smaller round from the other interested investors or cut burn to get profitable</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Turns out if we cut our growth spending, we can actually be cash-flow positive at current revenue levels. We'd grow slower (maybe 50% instead of 100% this year) but we'd have leverage in negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Lesson learned: Don't raise from a position of desperation. Thanks everyone for the reality check.</p>

                    <p>Smart approach. Getting to profitability (or near-profitability) completely changes the negotiating dynamic. You go from "need money to survive" to "want money to accelerate growth."</p>
                    <p>One more thing to add to your counter: ask them to explain their rationale for the participating preferred. Sometimes investors will back down just from having to justify aggressive terms out loud.</p>
                    <p>Good luck with the process. Feel free to DM me if you need a second set of eyes on the revised terms once you get them.</p>
