                    <p>I've run a bakery in a strip mall in Glendale for 8 years. My lease is up in 4 months and the landlord is refusing to renew. He's also been making my life hell:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shutting off my HVAC "for maintenance" during business hours</li>
                        <li>Parking construction equipment in front of my entrance</li>
                        <li>Telling other tenants I'm "going out of business soon"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I spent $85,000 on tenant improvements when I moved in - custom ovens, ventilation, walk-in cooler. My lease says these become property of the landlord. I'm devastated.</p>
                    <p>Do I have any rights here? Is there anything like rent control for commercial tenants?</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately there's no "commercial rent control" in California. Unlike residential tenants, commercial tenants have very few statutory protections. The landlord generally has no obligation to renew your lease unless your lease specifically says otherwise.</p>
                    <p>I went through something similar with my retail store in 2022. It sucks but the reality is commercial leases are "business to business" and courts assume both parties are sophisticated.</p>

                    <p>Let me address a few things here:</p>
                    <p><strong>On renewal rights:</strong> @RetailSurvivor is correct that there's no general right to renewal. However, check your lease carefully for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Options to renew (did you exercise any option properly?)</li>
                        <li>Right of first refusal</li>
                        <li>Right to match any offer made to a new tenant</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>On the harassment:</strong> This is where you may have leverage. Even though commercial tenants have fewer protections, landlords still have duties under the lease. Shutting off HVAC and blocking your entrance likely violates the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and possibly specific lease terms about common areas and utilities.</p>
                    <p>Document everything. Photos, videos, dates and times. If he's intentionally interfering with your business, you may have claims for breach of contract and tortious interference.</p>

                    <p>I just pulled out my lease. There's no renewal option - my lawyer at the time said it wasn't necessary since I'd been there so long and had a "good relationship" with the landlord. Huge regret.</p>
                    <p>What about the $85K in improvements? The lease says "All alterations and improvements shall become the property of Landlord upon installation." Can I at least negotiate compensation for these?</p>

                    <p>That clause is pretty standard unfortunately. From the landlord's perspective, they want the improvements to stay with the property, especially kitchen buildouts that are expensive to remove and reinstall.</p>
                    <p>Some leases have "trade fixture" exceptions that let you remove specialized equipment. Does yours mention anything about trade fixtures or FF&E (furniture, fixtures, and equipment)?</p>

                    <p>The COVID commercial eviction protections have essentially expired. California's SB 91 and later extensions protected commercial tenants from eviction for unpaid rent during the pandemic, but those were temporary and have sunset.</p>
                    <p>However, @BakeryOwnerLA - this isn't an eviction situation. The landlord isn't trying to evict you for cause; they're simply not renewing. That's a different legal scenario.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the tenant improvements, I want to add something important: the personal guarantee issue. Did you personally guarantee the lease? If so, you need to make sure you're completely clean on all lease obligations before you leave, or the landlord could pursue you personally for any claims.</p>

                    <p>Yes, I personally guaranteed the lease. My LLC is the tenant but I signed a personal guarantee for the full lease term.</p>
                    <p>Is there any trade fixture language... let me check... The lease says "Tenant may remove trade fixtures at the end of the term provided Tenant repairs any damage caused by removal and is not in default." That's something at least?</p>

                    <p>That trade fixture clause is actually good news. The question is what qualifies as a "trade fixture" versus a permanent improvement. Generally:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Trade fixtures</strong> (you can take): Equipment that can be removed without significant damage - ovens, refrigerators, display cases, POS systems</li>
                        <li><strong>Permanent improvements</strong> (landlord keeps): Built-in ventilation hoods, floor drains, electrical upgrades, walls</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your commercial ovens and walk-in cooler are likely trade fixtures you can remove. The ventilation system is probably a permanent improvement you lose.</p>

                    <p>Here's my practical advice for next steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Document the harassment</strong> - Keep a detailed log with photos/videos. This gives you negotiating leverage and potential legal claims.</li>
                        <li><strong>Send a formal letter</strong> - Have an attorney send a letter demanding the landlord stop interfering with your business operations. Reference the quiet enjoyment clause.</li>
                        <li><strong>Get quotes for relocation</strong> - Start looking for new spaces now. 4 months goes fast.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inventory your trade fixtures</strong> - Make a list of everything you plan to remove with photos and documentation of what you paid.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consider negotiating</strong> - Sometimes landlords will pay tenants to leave early and cleanly. If he wants you out and you have harassment claims as leverage, there might be a deal to be made for compensation.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The harassment is actually your best leverage here. Landlords don't want lawsuits, especially documented ones with photos of blocked entrances.</p>

                    <p>Update: I hired a commercial real estate attorney and she sent a letter about the harassment. The HVAC shutoffs and parking issues stopped immediately.</p>
                    <p>We're now negotiating. Landlord wants me out by end of lease (he apparently has a chain restaurant lined up to take the space). My attorney is pushing for either a 6-month extension to find new space, or a buyout payment for the improvements I'm leaving behind.</p>
                    <p>Also started looking at new locations. Already found a spot in Burbank that might work. Lesson learned: ALWAYS negotiate renewal options into commercial leases, and document your tenant improvements carefully.</p>
