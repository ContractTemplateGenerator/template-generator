                    <p>My restaurant is failing and I need to close. We're 18 months into a 5-year commercial lease in Florida. Monthly rent is $8,500.</p>
                    <p>The lease has an early termination clause that says if we terminate early, we owe "six months rent as liquidated damages." My landlord is now demanding $51,000 to let me out.</p>
                    <p>I'm literally closing because I can't afford the rent anymore. How can I possibly pay $51K? Is there any way to negotiate this down or challenge it?</p>

                    <p>Liquidated damages clauses in commercial leases are generally enforceable in Florida, but they must be reasonable. Courts will look at whether the amount is a reasonable estimate of the landlord's actual damages, not a penalty.</p>
                    <p>Key questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What does the exact lease language say?</li>
                        <li>How much time remains on the lease? (You said 3.5 years)</li>
                        <li>Is there a strong rental market in your area - would landlord likely re-rent quickly?</li>
                        <li>Does the lease require landlord to mitigate damages by trying to find a new tenant?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Six months rent for 3.5 years remaining might actually be reasonable if the landlord can re-rent within 6 months. But if the space sits vacant for a year, the landlord's actual damages would be way more than $51K.</p>

                    <p>The exact language is: "Tenant may terminate this Lease upon 60 days written notice and payment of liquidated damages equal to six (6) months Base Rent."</p>
                    <p>It's a decent location - downtown, good foot traffic. Probably could re-rent within 3-4 months I'd guess. The space next door has been vacant for a year though, so who knows.</p>
                    <p>Nothing in the lease about the landlord needing to mitigate or try to find a new tenant.</p>

                    <p>I'm a commercial landlord (in Texas not Florida, but similar principles). From the landlord's perspective, that 6 month provision is actually pretty tenant-friendly.</p>
                    <p>Think about it - you have 3.5 years left. If the landlord can't re-rent, they lose $357K in rent. Even if they re-rent in 6 months, they still lose $51K plus broker commissions (typically 6-8% of total lease value, so another $20-30K), tenant improvement allowances for the new tenant, attorney fees, etc.</p>
                    <p>The $51K might not even cover the landlord's actual costs. That said, you can always try to negotiate. Landlords prefer getting something over getting nothing.</p>

                    <p>A few important points about Florida law specifically:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Florida does NOT require landlords to mitigate damages in commercial leases (unlike residential). So even if the lease is silent, the landlord has no duty to try to re-rent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Liquidated damages:</strong> Florida courts uphold reasonable liquidated damages clauses. The test is whether the amount was a reasonable forecast of damages at the time the lease was signed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Penalty vs. liquidated damages:</strong> If a court finds it's a penalty (unreasonably high), it could be invalidated. But that's a high bar to meet.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The clause you quoted looks enforceable to me. Six months rent for a 5-year lease is within the range courts typically uphold.</p>

                    <p>So basically I'm screwed and have to pay it? I literally don't have $51K. My options are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Keep paying $8,500/month until I run out of money (maybe 2-3 more months)</li>

                    <p>Option 4: Bankruptcy. I went through this with my retail store. Filed Chapter 7, rejected the lease as part of the bankruptcy. Landlord filed a claim for damages but only recovered pennies on the dollar.</p>
                    <p>Not saying bankruptcy is the right move for you, but it's an option if you're facing closure anyway. Consult a bankruptcy attorney to understand the pros/cons.</p>
                    <p>The $51K early termination fee would become an unsecured claim in bankruptcy and might get discharged entirely or partially.</p>

                    <p>Before going the bankruptcy route, try negotiating. I'm a commercial real estate broker and I've seen many of these situations resolve.</p>
                    <p>Landlords know that tenants who can't afford rent also can't afford $51K lump sum. Some negotiation strategies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Installment plan:</strong> Offer to pay the $51K over 12-18 months</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduced lump sum:</strong> Offer $25-30K cash today to walk away clean</li>
                        <li><strong>Help find replacement tenant:</strong> Offer to find and pay for marketing to backfill the space, reducing the termination fee</li>
                        <li><strong>Personal guarantee release:</strong> If you personally guaranteed the lease, landlord might reduce fee in exchange for keeping the corporate guarantee alive</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Most landlords would rather negotiate than chase a bankrupt tenant for years.</p>

                    <p>Good advice from NegotiationBroker. Here's what I tell my clients in your situation:</p>
                    <p><strong>Your leverage:</strong> Landlord wants to avoid</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Litigation (costs them $10-20K in attorney fees)</li>
                        <li>Empty space generating $0 income while they sue you</li>
                        <li>Bankruptcy risk (they get nothing or pennies)</li>
                        <li>Damaged/abandoned property they have to clean out</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Your proposal should be:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A specific number you CAN pay (be realistic)</li>
                        <li>A timeline that works for both parties</li>
                        <li>Clean handover - you leave the space in good condition, all keys/access returned</li>
                        <li>Mutual release - nobody sues anybody</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Put it in writing. Be professional. Show you're trying to do the right thing given bad circumstances. Many landlords will work with you.</p>

                    <p>So total $44K - about $7K less than the lease requires. Think that's worth proposing?</p>
                    <p>I did personally guarantee the lease (which terrifies me). The LLC has no assets, so if they sue me personally I'm really screwed.</p>

                    <p>$20K now + $24K over 12 months = $44K total. You're only $7K short of the contractual amount. That's absolutely worth proposing.</p>
                    <p>Frame it as: "I'm offering 86% of the liquidated damages amount, with $20K upfront and guaranteed monthly payments. Alternative is I file bankruptcy and you get $0."</p>
                    <p>The personal guarantee actually helps your negotiating position in a weird way - it shows you're taking this seriously and trying to make it right. But it also means bankruptcy really is nuclear option for you.</p>
                    <p>Definitely worth the proposal. Worst case they say no and you're in the same position you are now.</p>

                    <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Sent my proposal on Oct 15. Landlord came back today and accepted with one change - wants $22K upfront and 15 months at $2K/month (total $52K).</p>
                    <p>It's $1K more than the lease required but spread out so I can actually afford it. Meeting Friday to sign the termination agreement.</p>
                    <p>Huge relief. Thanks everyone for the advice - would have just given up and gotten sued if I hadn't asked here first.</p>

                    <p>Great outcome! Before you sign Friday, make absolutely sure the termination agreement includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Full release of you and the LLC from all lease obligations upon final payment</li>
                        <li>Release of your personal guarantee upon final payment</li>
                        <li>What happens if you miss a payment (can they accelerate? Sue for full balance? Grace period?)</li>
                        <li>Confirmation of security deposit handling</li>
                        <li>Your obligation to return property in what condition</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Consider having an attorney review before signing - should be $300-500 for a document review. Could save you from issues later.</p>
