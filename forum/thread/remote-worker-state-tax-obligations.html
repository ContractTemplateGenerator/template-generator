                    <p>I just got hired for a fully remote W-2 position. The company is based in New York, but I live in Texas. They're withholding NY state taxes from my paycheck even though I've never set foot in New York and do all my work from my home in Austin.</p>
                    <p>Is this right? I thought remote workers only pay taxes in the state where they actually live and work. I don't want to deal with filing NY state taxes when I'm never there.</p>

                    <p>Texas has no state income tax so you got lucky there! But yeah, they shouldn't be withholding NY taxes if you're working exclusively from Texas.</p>
                    <p>Tell your HR to update your withholding. This is their mistake, not yours.</p>

                    <p>This is actually more nuanced than it seems. Let me break down the key issues:</p>
                    <p>First, you're right that generally remote workers pay taxes in their state of residence where they perform the work. Since you're in Texas (no income tax) working for a NY company, you typically wouldn't owe NY taxes.</p>
                    <p>However, there are some important exceptions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Convenience of employer rule:</strong> NY has this unusual rule where if you're working remotely for your convenience (not the employer's necessity), NY can still tax your wages. This is controversial but currently valid.</li>
                        <li><strong>Physical presence:</strong> If you ever go to NY office for meetings, training, etc., those days may be taxable in NY</li>
                        <li><strong>Company registration:</strong> The employer needs to be registered to withhold in your state of residence</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Wait, the "convenience of employer" rule sounds insane. So NY can just tax me even though I don't live there and never work there?</p>
                    <p>The job posting was always listed as remote. I never had the option to work in their office. How can that be for my convenience?</p>

                    <p>I went through this exact thing last year. NY's convenience rule is real and it's aggressive. A few states have it (NY, NE, DE, PA, CT, NJ in some cases).</p>
                    <p>The good news: Texas will give you a credit for taxes paid to NY, so you won't be double-taxed. The bad news: oh wait, Texas has no income tax, so you just lose that money to NY.</p>
                    <p>I ended up negotiating a higher salary to offset the unexpected tax burden.</p>

                    <p>The convenience rule is indeed controversial. New Hampshire actually sued Massachusetts over a similar issue during COVID.</p>
                    <p>Here's what you should do:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Ask HR for documentation on why they're withholding NY taxes</li>
                        <li>Request a written statement that your remote work is required by the employer, not for your convenience</li>
                        <li>Check if they're registered to withhold in Texas (they should be, even though TX has no income tax, for federal reporting)</li>
                        <li>Consider having the company consult with a multi-state tax attorney</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The employer has an obligation to withhold correctly. If you're truly working 100% from Texas with no office requirement, you should be able to challenge this.</p>

                    <p>Another thing to watch out for: some companies just default to withholding in their home state because their payroll system isn't set up for multi-state. It's lazy and wrong, but it happens.</p>
                    <p>I worked for a company that had remote workers in 15 states but their payroll provider only supported 3 states initially. Took them months to fix it.</p>

                    <p>That's not how it works. "Company policy" doesn't override state tax law. The employer has a legal obligation to withhold in the correct jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>If they're telling you to "sort it out" at tax time, that means you'd have to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>File a NY nonresident return to get a refund of taxes you never owed</li>
                        <li>Wait months for NY to process the refund (they're notoriously slow)</li>
                        <li>Deal with potential audits or complications</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I'd recommend sending HR a formal written request citing that you work 100% from Texas, have no NY nexus, and under Pub 131 they should not be withholding NY taxes. Copy their legal/compliance team if possible.</p>
                    <p>If they refuse, you may want to consult with an employment attorney. Employers can face penalties for incorrect withholding.</p>

                    <p>This is exactly why I only work for companies in states with no income tax now (TX, FL, WA, NV, etc.). The multi-state tax thing is a nightmare.</p>
