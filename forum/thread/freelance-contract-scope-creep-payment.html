                    <p>I'm a freelance web designer. I completed a website project for a client - delivered everything in the scope of work, got their approval, and sent the final invoice.</p>
                    <p>Now they're saying they want "a few small tweaks" before they'll pay. I asked for specifics and they sent me a list of changes that would take at least 20 hours: complete redesign of two pages, new functionality that was never discussed, additional content sections, etc.</p>
                    <p>My contract says I include "two rounds of revisions" which we already completed. It also says the project is considered complete when deliverables match the scope of work, which they do.</p>
                    <p>They're saying the tweaks are "implied" and that I should do them as part of "good customer service." They haven't paid the final $3,500 yet and now I'm worried they won't pay at all.</p>
                    <p>What are my options here? Do I have to do the extra work or can I demand payment for the completed project as-is?</p>

                    <p>Classic scope creep. I've dealt with this so many times.</p>
                    <p>Your contract is your friend here. If you completed the scope of work and exhausted the revision rounds, you've fulfilled your obligations. They owe you payment.</p>
                    <p>I would send a professional but firm email explaining:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Original scope has been completed per contract</li>
                        <li>Revision rounds were used</li>
                        <li>Additional work requires a change order and additional payment</li>
                        <li>Payment for completed work is due per contract terms</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Don't do ANY additional work until the current invoice is paid and a new contract/change order is signed for the additional scope.</p>

                    <p><strong>The legal analysis:</strong></p>
                    <p>You have a written contract that defines:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The scope of work</li>
                        <li>The revision policy (two rounds)</li>
                        <li>The completion criteria</li>
                        <li>The payment terms</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If you delivered what the contract required, payment is due. The client cannot unilaterally add requirements after the fact.</p>
                    <p><strong>The "implied" argument has no legal basis</strong> when you have a written contract that explicitly defines the scope. Under the parol evidence rule, they can't claim additional unwritten terms that contradict the written agreement.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your leverage points:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The contract defines completion - you met that standard</li>
                        <li>Revisions were contractually limited and have been exhausted</li>
                        <li>Additional work requires additional compensation (basic contract law)</li>
                        <li>Withholding payment for completed work is breach of contract</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Recommended approach:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Send written demand for payment citing contract completion</li>
                        <li>Offer to provide additional requested work under a new change order with separate payment</li>
                        <li>Set deadline for payment (typically 10 days)</li>
                        <li>Be prepared to pursue collections or small claims if they don't pay</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Thank you. That's helpful to know I'm on solid legal ground.</p>
                    <p>My concern is that they're a bigger company and could just refuse to pay and drag this out. What happens if I demand payment and they just ignore me? Do I really have to sue them over $3,500?</p>
                    <p>Also, I'm worried about my reputation. They've hinted they might leave bad reviews if I don't do the extra work. Is that legal for them to do?</p>

                    <p><strong>On collection options:</strong></p>
                    <p>You don't necessarily have to sue in full court. Options include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Demand letter:</strong> Often resolves the matter when they realize you're serious</li>
                        <li><strong>Collections agency:</strong> You can sell or assign the debt to a collection agency (you'll get less than full amount but no hassle)</li>
                        <li><strong>Small claims court:</strong> For $3,500, this is perfect for small claims. Lower cost, simpler process, no attorney required in most states</li>
                        <li><strong>Mechanic's lien:</strong> Depending on your state and the nature of work, you might have lien rights on the website/content</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>On the review threat:</strong></p>
                    <p>Threatening negative reviews to extort free work is potentially:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Blackmail/extortion (criminal in some states)</li>
                        <li>Defamation if the review contains false statements</li>
                        <li>Violation of consumer protection laws</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If they make this threat in writing, SAVE IT. That's evidence of bad faith and can actually strengthen your position.</p>
                    <p>You can respond: "I'm disappointed to hear you're threatening negative reviews to avoid payment for completed work. I've fulfilled my contractual obligations and expect payment as agreed. I'm happy to provide additional services under a separate agreement."</p>

                    <p>I manage freelancers at an agency and we deal with this from both sides.</p>
                    <p>From a practical standpoint, I'd recommend a softer approach first before going full legal:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Schedule a call</strong> - Sometimes these disputes are based on miscommunication. Get on the phone and walk through what you delivered vs what they're asking for.</li>
                        <li><strong>Itemize the difference</strong> - Create a detailed breakdown showing original scope vs. new requests with estimated hours for each.</li>
                        <li><strong>Offer a compromise</strong> - Maybe you do 2-3 hours of minor adjustments as goodwill, but anything beyond that requires a change order.</li>
                        <li><strong>Present change order</strong> - Send a formal change order for the additional work at your hourly rate, contingent on payment of original invoice.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This approach maintains the relationship while still protecting your rights and gets them to see the scope creep in black and white.</p>

                    <p>I learned this the hard way after getting burned on three different projects.</p>
                    <p>Now my contracts explicitly include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Detailed scope of work with specific deliverables listed</li>

                        <li>Late payment penalties (1.5% per month)</li>
                        <li>Right to remove/disable work if final payment isn't made within 30 days</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The "right to disable" clause has been huge. Clients pay real fast when they realize you can take the website down for non-payment.</p>

                    <p>Update: I took the advice and scheduled a call with the client. I went through the original scope item by item showing what was delivered. Then I created a detailed breakdown of their new requests showing it was 22 hours of additional work.</p>
                    <p>I explained that I'm happy to do the additional work but it requires a change order since it's outside the original scope. I offered to discount my rate by 10% as a goodwill gesture since we've worked together.</p>
                    <p>They backed down significantly. Turns out the "must have" list was mostly their marketing team throwing ideas around, not actual requirements. They agreed to pay the original invoice and signed a much smaller change order for about 5 hours of actual important updates.</p>
                    <p>Crisis averted. Lesson learned about being firm but professional.</p>

                    <p>Excellent outcome! This is exactly the right approach.</p>
                    <p>A few additional tips for your next contract:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Define "revision" explicitly:</strong> "A revision means modifications to existing deliverables within the original scope. New features, pages, or functionality constitute additional work."</li>
                        <li><strong>Include a change order process:</strong> "Any work outside the defined scope requires a written change order with estimated hours and costs."</li>
                        <li><strong>Add payment terms:</strong> "Final deliverables and source files will be released upon receipt of final payment."</li>
                        <li><strong>Consider a kill fee:</strong> "If project is terminated before completion, client owes X% of total fee for work completed."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Glad you got paid and maintained the client relationship!</p>

                    <p>Great resolution! This is why I always recommend the itemized breakdown approach.</p>
                    <p>When clients see "22 hours of work" written out line by line, they usually realize they're asking for way more than "a few tweaks." Often they didn't even realize how much they were requesting.</p>
                    <p>The fact that you offered the goodwill discount on the change order was smart - shows you're reasonable and want to work with them, while still protecting your boundaries.</p>

                    <p>Coming back to this thread because I'm dealing with something similar right now. Client approved final designs, I delivered all files, then two weeks later they emailed saying they want to "refresh the color palette" and add animations I specifically said weren't in scope.</p>
                    <p>Following the advice here - I created a detailed breakdown showing it's 12 hours of additional work and sent them a change order. They seemed surprised I was charging for it but haven't pushed back yet.</p>
                    <p>Question: how long should I give them to sign the change order before I just move on? I don't want to seem pushy but also don't want this hanging over my head for weeks.</p>
