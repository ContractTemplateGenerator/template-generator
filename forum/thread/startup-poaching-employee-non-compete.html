                    <p>I run a B2B SaaS company in Texas (15 employees). Our head of sales just gave notice - she's leaving to join a direct competitor that just raised a Series A. She signed a 2-year non-compete when we hired her 18 months ago.</p>
                    <p>The non-compete says she can't work for any competing software company within the US for 2 years. She's literally going to our biggest competitor. They know she has a non-compete because she told them.</p>
                    <p>Can I actually enforce this? What are my options?</p>

                    <p>Texas is actually one of the more employer-friendly states for non-competes. They're enforceable if they're reasonable in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Geographic scope</li>
                        <li>Duration</li>
                        <li>Scope of prohibited activity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A 2-year nationwide ban on working in software is almost certainly too broad. Texas courts look for non-competes that protect legitimate business interests without being oppressive to the employee.</p>
                    <p>What did she get in exchange for signing it? Just the job, or additional consideration?</p>

                    <p>She signed it as part of her offer letter when we hired her. Base salary was $95k plus commission. Is that enough consideration?</p>

                    <p>The job itself can be sufficient consideration in Texas if she signed it at the start of employment. If you had asked her to sign it after she was already working there without additional pay, that would be a problem.</p>
                    <p>The nationwide scope is likely too broad unless you can show you actually compete nationwide. Even if you have customers across the US, courts usually limit it to areas where you have a real competitive presence.</p>

                    <p>Before you go nuclear, consider this: litigation is insanely expensive and time-consuming. You'll spend $50k-$100k+ in legal fees, and it'll take 12-18 months to resolve.</p>
                    <p>Most of the time, the threat of a lawsuit is enough. Send a cease and desist to both her and the new company. A lot of companies will back off once they realize you're serious.</p>
                    <p>Also, if you sue for injunctive relief, you'll need to post a bond which could be $25k-$50k.</p>

                        <li><strong>Within 7 days:</strong> If they don't back down, file for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction</li>

                    <p>I went through something similar last year. We sent a cease and desist to the employee and their new employer. The new employer's lawyers responded saying our non-compete was unenforceable and they weren't backing down.</p>
                    <p>We ended up settling - she agreed to wait 6 months before starting (we paid her half salary during the waiting period), and she signed a stronger non-solicitation agreement.</p>
                    <p>Cost us about $30k in legal fees plus the settlement payment, but it was cheaper than full litigation.</p>
