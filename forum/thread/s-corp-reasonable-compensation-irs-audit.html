                    <p>I run an IT consulting business as an S-corp. My accountant set me up with a $40k salary and I'm taking about $150k in distributions this year. Total revenue is around $190k.</p>
                    <p>I just read an article about the IRS cracking down on S-corps with low reasonable compensation. Am I setting myself up for an audit? My accountant says it's fine but now I'm worried.</p>
                    <p>For context: I'm the only employee, I do all the work, and I live in Texas. What's actually considered "reasonable" here?</p>

                    <p>Yeah, that ratio seems really aggressive. The whole point of the IRS reasonable compensation requirement is to prevent exactly what you're doing - minimizing payroll taxes.</p>
                    <p>I've heard the rule of thumb is at least 60/40 salary to distributions, so you're way off. You're basically paying yourself 21% salary and taking 79% as distributions.</p>

                    <p>Tax attorney here. This is a legitimate concern, and frankly your accountant's advice worries me.</p>
                    <p><strong>The legal standard:</strong> IRC Section 162 requires that S-corp officer-employees receive "reasonable compensation" for services performed. The IRS doesn't give a specific formula, but they look at several factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What similar businesses pay for comparable services</li>
                        <li>Your qualifications and experience</li>
                        <li>Time and effort devoted to the business</li>
                        <li>Dividend history and overall compensation structure</li>
                        <li>Prevailing economic conditions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>The problem with your situation:</strong> You're the sole service provider generating $190k. If you hired someone to do your exact job, would they work for $40k? Almost certainly not in IT consulting.</p>
                    <p>In IRS audits like <em>David E. Watson P.C. v. United States</em> and <em>Sean McAlary Ltd. v. Commissioner</em>, the IRS successfully reclassified distributions as wages when the ratio was unreasonable.</p>

                    <p>A few things to consider:</p>
                    <p><strong>Reasonable salary range:</strong> For an IT consultant generating $190k as the sole producer, I'd expect to see salary in the $80k-$120k range at minimum. You could use sources like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bureau of Labor Statistics salary data for your occupation</li>
                        <li>RCReports (Risk Management Association) compensation studies</li>
                        <li>Industry-specific salary surveys</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Adjusting mid-year:</strong> Yes, you can and should increase your salary now. The IRS allows reasonable adjustments. It's better to correct it proactively than wait for an audit. Document your reasoning for the increase.</p>
                    <p><strong>The consequences of getting this wrong:</strong> If audited and deemed unreasonable, the IRS will:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Reclassify distributions as wages</li>
                        <li>Assess back payroll taxes (15.3% employer + employee FICA)</li>
                        <li>Add penalties and interest</li>
                        <li>You lose the tax benefit you thought you were getting</li>

                    <p>I run a similar business - solo consulting S-corp. My CPA has me at about 55% W-2 and 45% distributions. She said that's conservative but defensible.</p>
                    <p>The way she explained it: imagine you got hit by a bus tomorrow and had to hire someone to do your job. What would you have to pay them? That's your floor for reasonable comp.</p>
                    <p>I was trying to do something similar to you (lower salary) and she basically said "Do you want to save $5k in taxes now or risk a $30k tax bill plus penalties in an audit?"</p>

                    <p>The 60/40 "rule" is not from the IRS - it's a rule of thumb some accountants use, but it has no legal basis. The IRS has never published a safe harbor percentage.</p>
                    <p>What matters is the actual facts and circumstances test. I've seen defensible cases with 50/50 splits and cases with 70/30 that got challenged. It depends entirely on your industry, role, and market rates.</p>
                    <p>The IRS published a fact sheet (FS-2008-25) that lists the factors they consider, but they deliberately don't give percentages because every situation is different.</p>

                    <p>CPA chiming in here. I'd fire your accountant honestly.</p>
                    <p>$40k for an IT consultant generating $190k is going to be a red flag if the IRS ever looks at your return. The average IT consultant salary in most markets is $80k-$100k minimum.</p>
                    <p>Here's what I tell my S-corp clients: use the BLS data for your occupation code, adjust for your geographic area, and aim for at least the 50th percentile. Then document why you chose that amount.</p>
                    <p>Also - make sure your accountant is documenting the compensation determination in your corporate records. If audited, you want to show you made a good faith reasonable effort to comply.</p>

                    <p>Thanks everyone. This is really helpful and honestly pretty alarming. I'm going to find a new CPA who specializes in S-corps.</p>

                    <p>Smart move. And make sure your new CPA documents the compensation methodology in your corporate minutes. That contemporaneous documentation is your best defense if ever questioned.</p>
                    <p>Also consider looking at reasonable compensation studies or getting a formal compensation report if your revenue continues growing. For S-corps with significant income, it can be worth the $2k-$5k cost for the defensibility.</p>
