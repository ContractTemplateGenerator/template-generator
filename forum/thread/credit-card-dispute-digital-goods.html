                    <p>I bought a $2,000 "masterclass" on making money with AI. The sales page showed testimonials of people making $50k/month, professional production, the whole thing.</p>
                    <p>When I logged in, it was literally 6 YouTube videos (total runtime maybe 2 hours) with generic advice you could find for free. Nothing like what was advertised. I logged in, watched about 10 minutes, realized it was garbage, and immediately filed a credit card dispute.</p>
                    <p>The merchant responded with "proof" that I accessed the course portal and "consumed the digital product" so no refund. Chase sided with them and I'm out $2,000.</p>
                    <p>This feels like fraud. Do I have any recourse? Small claims? FTC complaint? Or am I just screwed because I clicked on a few videos?</p>

                    <p>This is why digital goods are so hard to dispute. The second you access anything, the merchant can claim you "received" the product.</p>
                    <p>You could try escalating with Chase - ask for arbitration through Visa/Mastercard (whichever network). But honestly, once they've ruled, it's hard to reverse.</p>

                    <p>The chargeback process has limitations, but you may still have legal options depending on what exactly was misrepresented.</p>
                    <p>Key questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What specific claims did they make on the sales page? (screenshot everything if you still can)</li>
                        <li>Did they have a refund policy posted?</li>
                        <li>Is this merchant/seller identifiable with a real business entity?</li>
                        <li>What state are you in and where are they based?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If they made specific false claims (like "you'll make $50k/month" or misrepresented what was included), that could be deceptive trade practices. But you'll need to prove what was promised vs. what was delivered.</p>

                    <p>I took screenshots of the sales page, thank god. It says things like "Proven system that generated $487K in 90 days" and "Join 10,000+ students making $10K+ per month."</p>
                    <p>Their refund policy says "30-day money back guarantee, no questions asked" but when I requested a refund through their system, they said "digital products are non-refundable once accessed."</p>
                    <p>I'm in California. The business is supposedly in Delaware (probably just incorporated there) but I think the guy running it is in Florida based on his social media.</p>

                    <p>Okay, you're in California - that's actually good for you. California has very strong consumer protection laws.</p>
                    <p>The contradiction between "30-day money back guarantee" and "non-refundable once accessed" is a problem for them. Under California law, if they advertise a refund policy, they have to honor it. They can't have a bait-and-switch where the refund policy is prominent in marketing but hidden exceptions make it impossible to actually get a refund.</p>
                    <p>California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 (Unfair Competition Law) and 17500 (False Advertising Law) both apply here. You have a few options:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>File a complaint with the California Attorney General's office</li>
                        <li>File a complaint with the FTC</li>
                        <li>Small claims court (CA allows up to $12,500)</li>
                        <li>Consult with a consumer protection attorney - some take these on contingency</li>

                    <p>Also check if they made any income claims without the proper FTC disclaimers. Saying "students making $10K+ per month" without disclaimers about typical results is an FTC violation.</p>
                    <p>The FTC has been cracking down hard on "make money online" courses with fake income claims. Your complaint could actually get traction.</p>

                    <p>Problem is collecting on it. If they're running this as a scam operation, they might not have attachable assets. But it's worth trying.</p>

                    <p>You can absolutely do both - file regulatory complaints AND pursue civil remedies. They're separate tracks.</p>
                    <p>For small claims, you'd sue the business entity. If it's a Delaware LLC, you need to sue the LLC and name the registered agent. You can serve them through their registered agent in Delaware.</p>
                    <p>California small claims courts can exercise jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants if they're doing business in California (which they are if they're selling to California residents). But getting them to show up is another matter.</p>
                    <p>The practical reality: many of these operators will ignore small claims court, leading to a default judgment. Then you have to figure out collections. But having a judgment is better than nothing - you can try to collect, and it's public record which can hurt their business.</p>

                    <p>Good plan. One more thing - check if there's a class action already forming. These scam courses often hit hundreds or thousands of people. Sometimes consumer protection attorneys will organize class actions.</p>
                    <p>Search "[course name] class action" or "[seller name] lawsuit" and see what comes up.</p>

                    <p>Update: Reported to Kajabi with screenshots of the income claims and the contradictory refund policy. They said they're investigating and will respond within 5 business days.</p>
                    <p>Also found a Reddit thread with 40+ people complaining about the same course. Looks like I'm not alone. Will keep everyone posted on how this resolves.</p>
