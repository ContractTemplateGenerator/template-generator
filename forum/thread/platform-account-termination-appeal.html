                    <p>That's 100% what triggered it. Amazon's system sees: same address, same network, one account closed → new account opened → must be ban evasion. The algorithm doesn't know she closed voluntarily vs was suspended.</p>
                    <p>Your appeal needs to address this directly. Show that the accounts had different principals (you vs her), different EINs if applicable, and that her account was closed in good standing.</p>

                    <p>Let's talk legal options, because the appeal process often fails:</p>
                    <p><strong>1. Amazon's Business Solutions Agreement arbitration.</strong> Section 18 requires individual arbitration through AAA. You can claim breach of contract if they're holding funds/inventory without valid cause. Filing fee is ~$200 and Amazon pays arbitrator fees for claims under $75K.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. State AG consumer protection complaint.</strong> Some states (especially Washington, where Amazon is HQ'd) have successfully pressured Amazon to review seller suspensions.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Small claims court for inventory.</strong> Some sellers have had success getting their physical inventory returned through small claims, since it's not technically a "funds" dispute.</p>

                    <p>Before you go legal, try the appeal properly. Most sellers write terrible appeals that get auto-rejected. Here's the format that works:</p>
                    <p><strong>Part 1: Root cause analysis.</strong> "I understand Amazon detected a relationship between my account and another account previously registered at my address. This account belonged to my spouse [name] and was closed in good standing on [date]."</p>
                    <p><strong>Part 2: Immediate corrective actions.</strong> "To prevent future confusion, I have [specific steps taken]."</p>
                    <p><strong>Part 3: Systemic preventive measures.</strong> "Going forward, I will [specific procedures]."</p>
                    <p>Attach: her account closure confirmation if available, your business docs showing it's your LLC not hers, anything proving the accounts were legitimately separate businesses.</p>

                    <p>That response was automated. Try escalating to jeff@amazon.com (goes to executive customer relations) with a concise email: who you are, what happened, that you've tried to appeal, and what you're asking for. Sometimes this gets human review.</p>
                    <p>If that fails, arbitration is your best bet. For $180K inventory + $45K funds, it's worth the cost. I've seen Amazon settle rather than go through full arbitration when the seller's case is sympathetic.</p>

                    <p>Great outcome. For others reading: the executive escalation email works maybe 20-30% of the time. When it doesn't, arbitration is still there. But always try the free options first.</p>
                    <p>And OP is right — if you have multiple potential sellers in a household, treat them as completely separate businesses from day one. Different devices, different IPs (use a dedicated business internet connection), different everything.</p>
