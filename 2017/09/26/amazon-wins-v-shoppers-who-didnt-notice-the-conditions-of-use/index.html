<p>Last week Amazon won a court case against its shoppers who did not carefully read the Conditions of Use. The moral of this story is that, <i><b>to successfully sue an eCommerce website, you have to read what almost nobody reads &#8211; the site terms and conditions of use. </b></i></p>
<p>The case is <i>Wiseley v. Amazon.com, Inc.</i>, No. 15-56799 (9th Cir. Sept. 19, 2017). Amazon shoppers got together and tried to file a class action lawsuit for deceptive business practices. Plaintiffs alleged that Amazon had falsely advertised and fraudulently misrepresented merchandise. That&#8217;s because Amazon&#8217;s reference prices (“was” prices, “sale” prices and crossed-out prices) were higher than prevailing market prices within the last three months. That&#8217;s illegal in California. Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code § 17501 states that, “No price shall be advertised as a former price . . . unless the alleged former price was the prevailing market price . . . within three months next immediately preceding the publication of the advertisement or unless the date when the alleged former price did prevail is clearly, exactly and conspicuously stated. . . .” In other words, plaintiffs claim that they were tricked into paying higher prices than what they would have paid for same goods at a brick-and-mortar store because of Amazon&#8217;s misleading listings in violation of California law. (Consumer Watchdog published a study on Amazon&#8217;s deceptive pricing practices most recently in <a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/historicalpricesfinal070617.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">July 2017</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/-NyAW4_GjeWI/WcpYp7MFZHI/AAAAAAAAJ_I/8Jo4_nktRow8RXBwJwh-J3xwPIuuW37xwCLcBGAs/s1600/amazon-arbitration-deceptive.png?ssl=1" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" border="0" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/-NyAW4_GjeWI/WcpYp7MFZHI/AAAAAAAAJ_I/8Jo4_nktRow8RXBwJwh-J3xwPIuuW37xwCLcBGAs/s400/amazon-arbitration-deceptive.png?resize=326%2C400&#038;ssl=1" width="326" /></a></div>
<p>But plaintiffs ultimately lost because of Amazon&#8217;s Conditions of Use that say: 1) shoppers cannot sue, they have to go to arbitration instead and 2) Washington law governs the sale, not California law. Private, closed door arbitration is better for Amazon than a public court where the whole country can watch. WA law is, arguably, less favorable to consumers than CA law in this case.</p>
<p>In most cases, website Terms of Use (a.k.a. Terms and Conditions, EULA, Conditions of Use, etc.) are a contract that is as legally binding as a signed paper contract, even if you didn&#8217;t read it. That is if it is presented conspicuously enough on the site and doesn&#8217;t contain any unconscionable, abusive provisions that are way out of line. In  Amazon&#8217;s case, their Conditions are presented conspicuously enough at least twice: 1) when you register an account and 2) when you confirm an order.</p>
<div></div>
<p>So, that&#8217;s why the proposed class action fell apart and the plaintiffs were told by the Ninth Circuit to arbitrate their claims on an individual basis. It is similar to a <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/second-circuit-issues-important-decision-regarding-online-contract-formation-and" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent victory</a> of Uber over its customers. Read the terms and conditions.</p>
