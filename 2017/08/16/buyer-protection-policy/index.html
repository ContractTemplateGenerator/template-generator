<p>This is a template Buyer Protection Policy, similar to that of eBay, for your eCommerce platform. Having such policy will give your buyer extra peace of mind knowing that there is an additional layer on protection on your platform for them.</p>
<p>Key specs:</p>
<p>&#8211; Policy <b><i>applies to non delivery, damaged, not as described items or empty boxes.</i></b></p>
<p>&#8211; Buyer should contact the seller first to try and resolve the issue. If unsuccessful, then they can file a dispute.</p>
<p>Excluded:</p>
<p>&#8211; <b><i>Buyer’s mistake, remorse/change of mind, fraud</i></b>. </p>
<p>&#8211; <b><i>Duplicate claims</i></b>. If buyer had used other resolution process such as PayPal Purchase Protection or a chargeback, then they are not eligible for this Buyer Protection.</p>

<div class="MsoNormal"><b><u><span lang="EN-US">Overview </span></u></b></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This Policy applies to non delivery, damaged, not as described items or empty boxes.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8211;           <b><i>Non delivery</i></b>. If we determine that the item was not delivered, we refund the full cost of the item and original shipping. The seller must then reimburse us for the amount. If the buyer refuses delivery, their claim is not eligible for our Buyer Protection, unless the buyer can prove, via written evidence from the carrier, that the package was refused because it arrived empty or was damaged in shipping.</span></div>
<p><a name='more'></a></p>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8211;           <b><i>Item damaged or not as described, empty box</i></b>.  If you receive an item that doesn&#8217;t match the listing description, you have to request a return from the seller. If the seller does not respond or offer a solution (such as accepting a return, offering a replacement or refund), then you can file a dispute with us. We will review the item description, photos of the item received and any other relevant information. If the seller accepts a return, the buyer must return the item in the same condition in which it was received. After confirming that the item was returned to the seller, we refund the full cost of the item and original shipping and the seller must reimburse us for the full amount. In some cases, we do not require items returned to the seller before we refund the buyer and may seek reimbursement from the seller. For example if the seller chooses not to accept a return request, the item location was misrepresented. In some cases, we can issue a partial refund to cover differences between how the item was described in the listing and the actual item the buyer received. In that case, the buyer will not be asked to return the item but the seller must reimburse us for the partial refund.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal"><b><u><span lang="EN-US">Exclusions</span></u></b><span lang="EN-US"> </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The following issues are not covered by this Policy:</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8211;           Buyer’s mistake/remorse/change of mind: you bought a wrong item or subsequently decided that you do not want it.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8211;           Item already refunded: you already received a refund from the seller or anyone else for the item in full (including shipping). If you only received a partial refund, we will consider whether this has fulfilled the seller’s obligations. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8211;           Items damaged during pick-up or shipping. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8211;           Items shipped to another address after original delivery.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8211;           Duplicate claims. If you had used other resolution process (e.g., PayPal Purchase Protection, or requesting a chargeback from your payment provider), then you can only use that method to resolve the problem with the item. You are not eligible for our Buyer Protection.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8211;           Fraud: No refunds are issued if we believe the claim is fraudulent.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8211;           Before filing a dispute with us, the buyer must contact the seller within 30 days of receipt or the latest estimated delivery date. The seller must respond in 3 business days. If the seller does not respond or offer a suitable solution, the buyer can file a dispute with us within 30 days of contacting the seller.  In some cases, we may extend the deadline to file a dispute with us due to special circumstances (e.g., fraud, the buyer is in a remote location, force majeure).</span></div>
