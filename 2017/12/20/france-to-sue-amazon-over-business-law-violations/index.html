The lawsuit is a result of an investigation by the Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), the French body in charge of fraud oversight.</p>
<p>On Monday, the DGCCRF has issued a statement that Le Maire is seeking a fine of 10 million euros ($11.8 million). DGCCRF investigation found that Amazon imposed a series of abusive clauses to its commercial partners in France, including the option to modify or terminate contracts unilaterally.</p>
<p>The DGCCRF stated that the French government wants &#8220;to better regulate the activity of large digital platforms and to ensure greater transparency, balance and loyalty in their relations with companies.&#8221; Amazon declined to comment citing its policy of not commenting on judicial proceedings.</p>
