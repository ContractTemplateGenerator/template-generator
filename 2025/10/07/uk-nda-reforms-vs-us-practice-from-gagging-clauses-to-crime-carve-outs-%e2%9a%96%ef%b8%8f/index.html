      <h1>UK NDA Reforms vs US Practice: From “Gagging Clauses” to Crime Carve-Outs ⚖️</h1>
      <div class="meta">Published: October 7, 2025 • NDA</div>
      <div class="content">
<p>Non-disclosure agreements have gone from sleepy boilerplate to political lightning rods.</p>



<p>The UK has just moved decisively to rein in the use of NDAs to silence victims of abuse and crime, while the US is still living in a patchwork world of federal carve-outs and state-by-state restrictions.</p>



<p>If you’re drafting NDAs, settlement agreements, or employment contracts for clients who operate in both jurisdictions, the divergence is now big enough that you can’t just “tweak the governing law clause” and call it a day.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Snapshot_of_the_New_UK_NDA_Regime_%F0%9F%87%AC%F0%9F%87%A7"></span>Snapshot of the New UK NDA Regime 🇬🇧<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Three overlapping developments are reshaping NDAs in England &amp; Wales:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Victims_and_Prisoners_Act_2024_%E2%80%93_Section_17_in_force_1_October_2025"></span>Victims and Prisoners Act 2024 – Section 17 (in force 1 October 2025)<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Section 17 radically limits how far a confidentiality clause can bite against anyone who is, or reasonably believes themselves to be, a <strong>victim of crime</strong>.</p>



<p>For NDAs entered into on or after 1 October 2025:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Any provision is <strong>unenforceable</strong> to the extent it purports to stop a victim from sharing information about the relevant conduct with specified “permitted” recipients, for specified purposes. (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/victims-and-prisoners-act-2024-changes-to-non-disclosure-agreements/victims-and-prisoners-act-2024-changes-to-non-disclosure-agreements?utm_source=chatgpt.com">GOV.UK</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>Those permitted recipients include (in summary):</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the police and other law-enforcement bodies,</li>



<li>lawyers,</li>



<li>medical professionals, and</li>



<li>recognised support services and certain regulators.</li>
</ul>



<p>The government guidance for individuals puts it bluntly: if you’re a victim of crime, your NDA cannot stop you reporting to the police or getting advice and support. (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/victims-and-prisoners-act-2024-changes-to-non-disclosure-agreements/victims-and-prisoners-act-2024-changes-to-non-disclosure-agreements-for-victims-and-individuals-who-use-ndas?utm_source=chatgpt.com">GOV.UK</a>)</p>



<p>The same basic principle applies to <strong>witnesses</strong> in many contexts: the intention is that NDAs cannot be used to obstruct criminal justice or keep systemic abuse buried.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Employment_Rights_Bill_2025_%E2%80%93_Harassment_and_Discrimination_NDAs"></span>Employment Rights Bill 2025 – Harassment and Discrimination NDAs<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>The new Labour government has also amended the <strong>Employment Rights Bill</strong> to go after “gagging clauses” used in workplace harassment and discrimination cases.</p>



<p>Core ideas in the reforms:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>NDAs that <strong>silence victims of harassment or discrimination</strong> will be null and void.</li>



<li>The ban will extend to confidentiality and non-disparagement clauses in <strong>settlement agreements and employment contracts</strong>, not just standalone NDAs. (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ban-on-controversial-ndas-silencing-abuse?utm_source=chatgpt.com">GOV.UK</a>)</li>



<li>Employers <strong>cannot require</strong> a gagging NDA in resolving harassment / discrimination claims; confidentiality can only be included where the <strong>worker actively requests</strong> it, subject to safeguards. (<a href="https://www.gtlaw.com/en/insights/2025/7/uk-government-proposes-ban-on-ndas-in-harassment-and-discrimination-cases?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Greenberg Traurig</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>At the same time, disclosures by workers about sexual harassment are being treated as <strong>protected whistleblowing</strong> for employment-law purposes, so NDAs cannot cut across those rights. (<a href="https://www.doyleclayton.co.uk/resources/insights/non-disclosure-agreements-new-restrictions-in-force-from-1-october/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Doyle Clayton</a>)</p>



<p>The net effect: confidentiality is still possible in principle, but the default flips. Silence about harassment and discrimination is no longer something employers can buy; it is, at best, something a worker can choose.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ACAS_sector_guidance_and_higher-education_lead-in"></span>ACAS / sector guidance and higher-education lead-in<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>ACAS and government guidance have been updated to reflect the new regime. Even before the latest reforms, NDAs already couldn’t lawfully stop: (<a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/non-disclosure-agreements?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Acas</a>)</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>whistleblowing,</li>



<li>reporting a crime to the police,</li>



<li>discussing pay for equal-pay purposes.</li>
</ul>



<p>Since August 2025, employers in <strong>higher education</strong> in England have been specifically barred from using NDAs to stop workers disclosing bullying, harassment, or sexual misconduct. From October 2025, the crime-victim carve-outs extend across all sectors. (<a href="https://barcankirby.co.uk/ban-on-ndas-to-silence-abuse/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Barcan and Kirby Solicitors in Bristol</a>)</p>



<p>This is not just soft guidance: NDAs that conflict with those statutory carve-outs are <strong>void and unenforceable</strong> to that extent.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_US_Landscape_Narrow_Federal_Carve-Outs_and_State-Level_Innovation_%F0%9F%87%BA%F0%9F%87%B8"></span>The US Landscape: Narrow Federal Carve-Outs and State-Level Innovation 🇺🇸<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Contrasted with the UK’s national reforms, US NDA law is more fragmented.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Federal_The_Speak_Out_Act_and_companions"></span>Federal: The Speak Out Act and companions<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>At the federal level, the key statute is the <strong>Speak Out Act</strong> (2022).</p>



<p>It does <strong>not</strong> ban NDAs outright. Instead, it makes pre-dispute NDAs and non-disparagement clauses <strong>judicially unenforceable</strong> to the extent they would prevent a person from speaking about <strong>sexual assault or sexual harassment</strong> in the workplace or in certain other contexts. (<a href="https://onlabor.org/how-did-metoo-change-employment-law/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">OnLabor</a>)</p>



<p>Important boundaries:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It focuses on <strong>pre-dispute</strong> clauses (e.g., boilerplate in employment contracts or handbooks).</li>



<li>It does <strong>not</strong> categorically invalidate post-dispute settlement confidentiality; parties may still agree to settlement NDAs, subject to other law.</li>
</ul>



<p>Alongside that, the <strong>Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act</strong> (EFAA) invalidates pre-dispute <strong>arbitration</strong> requirements in those cases, not NDAs themselves, but it’s part of the same policy trend.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="States_MeToo-driven_restrictions_on_harassmentdiscrimination_NDAs"></span>States: #MeToo-driven restrictions on harassment/discrimination NDAs<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>The real action is at state level.</p>



<p>By mid-2024, nearly <strong>20 states</strong> had enacted some form of restriction on NDAs in workplace sexual-misconduct contexts, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. (<a href="https://www.venable.com/insights/publications/2024/06/the-list-of-states-regulating-nondisclosure?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Venable</a>)</p>



<p>Patterns vary, but common features include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>bans on NDAs that <strong>prevent disclosure of factual information</strong> relating to sexual harassment or, in some states, broader discrimination;</li>



<li>requirements that confidentiality be <strong>employee-initiated</strong>, with cooling-off periods or separate written consent;</li>



<li>plain-language and translation requirements;</li>



<li>prohibitions on retaliation for speaking with law enforcement or regulators.</li>
</ul>



<p>For example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>California, Nevada, and New Jersey</strong> bar NDAs that prevent disclosure of facts underlying sexual-harassment claims in many settlement contexts. (<a href="https://www.littler.com/news-analysis/asap/metoo-defense-nondisclosure-agreements?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Littler Mendelson P.C.</a>)</li>



<li><strong>New York</strong> expanded earlier restrictions, limiting NDAs in settlements involving all forms of discrimination, not just sexual harassment, and layering in language and consent requirements. (<a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MeToo-State-Bills-2023-10.18.23.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">National Women&#8217;s Law Center</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>But there is <strong>no single US federal rule</strong> equivalent to the UK’s Section 17 or the UK-wide Employment Rights Bill reforms. Instead you get a mosaic of:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>narrow federal limits (Speak Out Act, EFAA);</li>



<li>strong NDA limits in some states;</li>



<li>relatively permissive regimes in others.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reforms reflect different baseline attitudes toward NDAs in the two systems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="UK_A_Public-Interest_Carve-Out_Superstructure"></span>UK: A Public-Interest Carve-Out Superstructure<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>UK policy is moving toward a simple position:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>You cannot contract out of the public interest in exposing crime, harassment, and discrimination.</strong></li>



<li>NDAs that try to do so will simply be carved back by statute and guidance.</li>
</ul>



<p>Section 17 doesn’t ask whether the NDA is overreaching in the traditional restraint-of-trade sense; it declares certain restrictions on victims’ speech <strong>void as a matter of law</strong>, regardless of the parties’ bargaining power. (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/victims-and-prisoners-act-2024-changes-to-non-disclosure-agreements/victims-and-prisoners-act-2024-changes-to-non-disclosure-agreements?utm_source=chatgpt.com">GOV.UK</a>)</p>



<p>The Employment Rights Bill then goes further in the HR context, flipping the presumption: in harassment/discrimination cases, silence is suspect unless the worker started it and statutory conditions are met. (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ban-on-controversial-ndas-silencing-abuse?utm_source=chatgpt.com">GOV.UK</a>)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="US_Incrementalism_Federalism_and_Context"></span>US: Incrementalism, Federalism, and Context<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>The US approach is more incremental and layered:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Federal law tweaks <strong>enforceability</strong> around sexual misconduct but leaves most NDA questions to states and general contract principles. (<a href="https://onlabor.org/how-did-metoo-change-employment-law/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">OnLabor</a>)</li>



<li>States layer targeted restrictions on top of that, many of them limited to <strong>employment</strong> and <strong>harassment/discrimination</strong> claims, often with opt-in confidentiality and cooling-off mechanics. (<a href="https://www.venable.com/insights/publications/2024/06/the-list-of-states-regulating-nondisclosure?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Venable</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>There is more tolerance for the idea that parties can choose to trade confidentiality for money in settlement, provided formalities are met and the employee isn’t completely silenced as to reporting to the government.</p>



<p>In practice, that means:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>some US jurisdictions are now nearly as strict as the UK in harassment contexts;</li>



<li>others remain permissive;</li>



<li>and a multi-state employer has to navigate this <strong>jurisdiction by jurisdiction</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For any employer with operations in both the UK and the US, the safe drafting move is to assume the <strong>UK floor applies everywhere</strong> and then tighten further for specific US states where required.</p>



<p>A simple way to think about it:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>🌍 Scenario</th><th>🎯 Drafting Approach That Ages Well</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>UK employment settlement involving harassment or discrimination</td><td>Treat confidentiality as optional and <strong>worker-driven</strong>, with express carve-outs for reporting to police, regulators, medical providers, advisers, trade unions, and support services. Include explicit language that nothing prevents whistleblowing or crime reporting, and mirror MOJ / ACAS guidance where possible.

<p>A few drafting habits are rapidly becoming “must-haves” in both systems:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Clear carve-outs for <strong>police, regulators, lawyers, healthcare providers, and support organisations</strong> where the person is a victim (or perceived victim) of crime or serious misconduct.</li>



<li>Express language that nothing in the NDA restricts <strong>protected whistleblowing</strong> or disclosure of unlawful discrimination / harassment to enforcement bodies.</li>



<li>Differentiation between <strong>commercial confidentiality</strong> (pricing, trade secrets, source code) and <strong>behavioural / misconduct facts</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>You can still write robust NDAs. The change is that in the UK, and increasingly in many US states, you have to accept that there are zones of speech you simply <strong>cannot</strong> lock down, even if both sides nominally “agree” at the time of signing.</p>

<p>The UK reforms—particularly the combination of Section 17 and the Employment Rights Bill—position it as one of the most aggressive jurisdictions in the world for curbing gagging NDAs in harassment, discrimination, and crime-adjacent contexts. (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ban-on-controversial-ndas-silencing-abuse?utm_source=chatgpt.com">GOV.UK</a>)</p>



<p>In the US, further movement is more likely to be <strong>state-driven</strong> than federal given current political dynamics, but the direction of travel in many blue and purple states is similar: more choice for victims, more carve-outs, and more suspicion of blanket secrecy provisions.</p>



<p>For practitioners, the bottom line is simple:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In UK matters, treat NDAs that purport to silence victims of crime or workplace abuse as <strong>inherently fragile</strong> and draft around the statutory carve-outs from the outset.</li>



<li>In US matters, stop thinking of “the NDA” as one product. For harassment/discrimination, you now have to design clauses around a moving target of federal carve-outs and state-level restrictions, many of which implicitly borrow the same logic the UK has just codified.</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s a headache if you want to reuse old forms—but it’s also a very good reason to re-tool your NDA templates now, while you’re not yet staring at a regulator’s press release or a #MeToo-style media story quoting your “standard” gagging clause.</p>
