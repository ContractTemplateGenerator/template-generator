      <h1>When Federal Judges Hallucinate: AI in the Courtroom Finally Hits the Wall ⚖️🤖</h1>
      <div class="meta">Published: October 10, 2025 • AI, News</div>
      <div class="content">
<p>In summer 2025, two U.S. federal judges signed orders that looked like they came from a parallel universe:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>fake party names,</li>



<li>quotes no one ever said,</li>



<li>misquoted statutes and case law,</li>



<li>references to evidence that didn’t exist in the record. (<a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/grassley-calls-on-the-federal-judiciary-to-formally-regulate-ai-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>By October, under pressure from <strong>Sen. Chuck Grassley</strong> and the Senate Judiciary Committee, both judges admitted the same thing:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Their chambers had used <strong>generative AI (Perplexity and ChatGPT)</strong> to help draft orders, failed to catch the hallucinations, and accidentally docketed the draft rulings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you write briefs, rely on judges to read them carefully, or build AI tools for legal work, this is one of those “mark your calendar” moments.</p>

<p>The incidents involve:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Judge Henry T. Wingate</strong> – U.S. District Court, Southern District of Mississippi</li>



<li><strong>Judge Julien Xavier Neals</strong> – U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey </li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Judge_Wingate_Perplexity_as_a_drafting_assistant"></span>Judge Wingate: Perplexity as a drafting assistant<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A law clerk in Wingate’s chambers used <strong>Perplexity AI</strong> to help draft a <strong>July 20, 2025 temporary restraining order</strong> in a civil-rights case. </li>



<li>The AI-generated draft included:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>parties who weren’t in the case,</li>



<li>allegations that didn’t exist,</li>



<li>quotes and references disconnected from the actual record.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>That draft was <strong>prematurely docketed</strong> before Wingate had fully reviewed and corrected it.</li>



<li>Lawyers in the case flagged the absurdities, and the order was quickly withdrawn and replaced—without a clear explanation until Grassley started asking questions. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/two-federal-judges-say-use-ai-led-errors-us-court-rulings-2025-10-23/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>In his October 23 letter to Grassley, Wingate admitted a clerk used Perplexity to “synthesize information” from the public docket and that the faulty order was an “early draft” that had escaped normal review. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Judge_Neals_ChatGPT_and_the_unauthorized_intern"></span>Judge Neals: ChatGPT and the unauthorized intern<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In New Jersey, <strong>Judge Julien Neals</strong> had a law-school intern who, in violation of chambers policy and their own law school’s policy, used <strong>ChatGPT</strong> to research and draft portions of an order in a securities case. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/two-federal-judges-say-use-ai-led-errors-us-court-rulings-2025-10-23/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</li>



<li>The draft included:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>fake quotes,</li>



<li>misstatements of case law,</li>



<li>and factual assertions not supported by the record.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>A temporary assistant then <strong>posted the draft to the docket prematurely</strong>, again before the judge’s full review.</li>



<li>After counsel flagged the errors, Neals withdrew the order and later told Grassley that his chambers has implemented a <strong>written AI-use policy and a tighter review process</strong>. </li>
</ul>



<p>In both courts, the bad orders <strong>briefly became part of the official record</strong> and had to be scrubbed, which is exactly what set Grassley off.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Grassleys_Reaction_%E2%80%9CIve_Never_Seen_Anything_Like_This%E2%80%9D_in_Federal_Court"></span>Grassley’s Reaction: “I’ve Never Seen Anything Like This” in Federal Court<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Grassley first sent letters on <strong>October 6, 2025</strong>, asking Wingate and Neals:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>whether generative AI was used,</li>



<li>what human review occurred,</li>



<li>how the errors slipped through, and</li>



<li>what guardrails were now in place. </li>
</ul>



<p>Once the answers came back, he went public:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>On the Senate floor he said the orders <strong>“misquoted state law, referenced individuals who didn’t appear in the case, and attributed fake quotes to defendants,”</strong> calling them “unfathomable.” (<a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/grassley-calls-on-the-federal-judiciary-to-formally-regulate-ai-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>)</li>



<li>He praised the judges for finally admitting AI use but warned: “If this isn’t a wake-up call, I’m here today to give a warning. I’m watching. All of Congress is now watching.” (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/senator-warns-us-judges-ai-misuse-courts-try-adapt-2025-10-28/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>Grassley is now pressing the <strong>Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts</strong> and the <strong>Judicial Conference</strong> to issue formal, uniform AI policies for judges and staff, not just for lawyers who file AI-tainted briefs. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/senator-warns-us-judges-ai-misuse-courts-try-adapt-2025-10-28/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_Bad_Were_the_Errors_Really"></span>How Bad Were the Errors, Really?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>This wasn’t just a stray typo or mis-cited case.</p>



<p>Across the faulty orders, reports highlight:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fake parties and declarants</strong> – references to people who had never appeared in the case. </li>



<li><strong>Nonexistent evidence</strong> – citations to “sworn declarations” or exhibits that didn’t exist in the docket. </li>



<li><strong>Misquoted statutes and case law</strong> – incorrect statutory text and quotes attributed to the wrong cases or parties. (<a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/grassley-calls-on-the-federal-judiciary-to-formally-regulate-ai-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>In other words, classic <strong>AI hallucinations</strong>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>plausible-looking legal prose with citations and quotes that collapse as soon as anyone checks.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Up to now, most of the public AI horror stories were about <strong>lawyers</strong> who filed AI-generated briefs and got sanctioned. This is the first front-page example of <strong>judicial chambers</strong> making the same mistake at scale.</p>

<p>After these incidents, you effectively have three layers of AI policy pressure on courts:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Grassley and Congress</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Calling for “urgent and uniform” AI guidelines across the federal judiciary.</li>



<li>Warning that delegating core judicial functions to AI is unacceptable. ()</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A task force issued <strong>interim AI guidelines in July 2025</strong> (not publicly released yet), with “temporary guideposts” on AI procurement, security, and use. ()</li>



<li>The memo reportedly <strong>“cautions against delegating core judicial functions to AI.”</strong> ()</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>State and federal courts setting their own rules</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A growing number of state systems (e.g., New York) have launched <strong>judicial AI policies</strong>: generally “trust but verify,” AI for efficiency only, not to replace judicial reasoning. ()</li>



<li>Many courts already have <strong>standing orders for lawyers</strong> about AI use; now they’re being pushed to look in the mirror and regulate judges’ own chambers the same way. ()</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>Neals says his chambers now has a <strong>written AI policy</strong> banning unauthorized use and reiterating that all drafts must be checked against the record. Wingate promises increased scrutiny and said he will not restore the flawed order to the docket to avoid confusion. ()</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_This_Means_for_Practitioners_and_for_Your_Own_AI_Policies"></span>What This Means for Practitioners (and for Your Own AI Policies)<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>For practicing lawyers and law-adjacent SaaS, this episode hits three pressure points.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="1_Judges_are_not_immune_to_the_same_AI_pitfalls_as_lawyers"></span>1. Judges are not immune to the same AI pitfalls as lawyers<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Up to now, judges have:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>sanctioned lawyers for citing non-existent cases,</li>



<li>required certifications that briefs aren’t AI-hallucinated, and</li>



<li>demanded disclosure of AI use in filings.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, litigants can say—fairly—that <strong>judges and their clerks have to live by similar rules</strong>. Expect:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>more <strong>formal AI policies from courts</strong> about chambers use;</li>



<li>more explicit <strong>disclosure obligations</strong> when AI touches an order;</li>



<li>more scrutiny of <strong>“drafting assistants”</strong> embedded in judicial CMS or research tools.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="2_%E2%80%9CTrust_but_verify%E2%80%9D_becomes_not_just_advice_but_a_standard"></span>2. “Trust but verify” becomes not just advice, but a standard<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>These incidents will be used as Exhibit A for the proposition that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>AI can assist</strong>,</li>



<li>but <strong>human verification</strong> is non-negotiable, especially in judicial documents.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re building legal tech:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>you should assume courts will <strong>require human-in-the-loop controls</strong>, audit logs, and clear <strong>“suggestion vs final”</strong> labeling in any drafting features.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re advising firms:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>you can justify <strong>formal AI policies, review protocols, and documentation</strong> by pointing directly to Wingate and Neals as what happens when you don’t.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="3_Hallucinations_are_now_a_judicial_ethics_and_due-process_issue"></span>3. Hallucinations are now a judicial ethics and due-process issue<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>When a judge’s order:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>invents facts, parties, or quotes,</li>



<li>and that order is entered on the docket,</li>
</ul>



<p>you’re not just dealing with a sloppy first draft—it’s a <strong>due process problem</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>parties might comply with or rely on the erroneous order;</li>



<li>appellate courts have to clean up the mess;</li>



<li>public trust in judicial neutrality and competence takes a hit.</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s why Grassley’s language was so sharp—this is being treated as a <strong>judicial-integrity issue</strong>, not a mere tech glitch. (<a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/grassley-calls-on-the-federal-judiciary-to-formally-regulate-ai-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>)</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_Litigation_Demand-Letter_Angle"></span>The Litigation &amp; Demand-Letter Angle<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>You can easily imagine how this filters into your existing niches:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Motion practice</strong> – When you see an order that smells like AI (strange citations, obviously wrong facts), you now have an open path to <strong>ask directly</strong>: “Your Honor, in light of the recent guidance and incidents involving AI use in judicial orders, we respectfully request clarification on whether any generative AI tools were used in drafting this order and, if so, confirmation that the cited authorities and record references have been independently verified.”</li>



<li><strong>Appellate briefs</strong> – If an order clearly relies on fictional law or facts, referencing Wingate/Neals in a footnote is now totally fair game to frame the need for <strong>heightened scrutiny or remand</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Legal-tech contracts and policies</strong> – For vendors selling AI tools into courts, law firms, or agencies, you need strong:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>“AI is assistive only” disclaimers</strong>,</li>



<li><strong>logging features</strong> for what’s suggested and what’s accepted,</li>



<li>and a paper trail showing you warned users not to delegate final judgment to the model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Bottom_Line_Courts_Just_Joined_the_AI-Compliance_Club"></span>Bottom Line: Courts Just Joined the AI-Compliance Club<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The Wingate and Neals episodes are small in terms of docket volume, but they’re huge as <strong>precedent in the court of public opinion</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>They prove that AI hallucinations are not just a “junior associate” problem.</li>



<li>They force the judiciary to <strong>regulate its own use of AI</strong>, not just lawyers’.</li>



<li>They give litigants, firms, and legal-tech builders concrete examples to point to when arguing for <strong>guardrails, policies, and human verification</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>In other words, AI in the courtroom isn’t hypothetical anymore. It’s in the Federal Reporter’s neighborhood—sometimes literally with fake citations—and everyone who touches that ecosystem now has to decide how they’re going to handle it, before their own name ends up in the next Grassley letter.</p>
