      <div class="content">
<p>Generative AI music went from party trick to litigation target in about 18 months.</p>



<p>On <strong>October 15–16, 2025</strong>, a group of independent musicians filed back-to-back <strong>class actions</strong> against <strong>Udio</strong> (Uncharted Labs) and <strong>Suno</strong>, alleging that both platforms built their models by quietly ingesting thousands of copyrighted sound recordings and songs without permission. (<a href="https://copyrightalliance.org/copyright-news-october-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Copyright Alliance</a>)</p>



<p>These are not the big-label lawsuits you saw from the RIAA in 2024. These are <strong>artist-led cases</strong>, framed as a direct attack on independent musicians’ livelihoods, and they’re designed to sit alongside (not instead of) label litigation. (<a href="https://www.riaa.com/record-companies-bring-landmark-cases-for-responsible-ai-againstsuno-and-udio-in-boston-and-new-york-federal-courts-respectively/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">RIAA</a>)</p>



<p>If you write, license, or build tools around music, this is the test case for what “AI infringement” actually looks like.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_Happened_in_the_Udio_and_Suno_Cases_%F0%9F%8E%A4"></span>What Happened in the Udio and Suno Cases 🎤<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>On <strong>October 15, 2025</strong>, a group of musicians including David Woulard, Stan and James Burjek, Berk Ergoz, Hamza Jilani, Maatkara Wilson, Arjun Singh, Magnus Fiennes, and Michael Mell filed a class action in federal court against <strong>Uncharted Labs, Inc. (d/b/a Udio)</strong>. </p>



<p>On <strong>October 16, 2025</strong>, the same group filed a substantially similar class action against <strong>Suno, Inc.</strong> </p>



<p>At a high level, they allege that each company:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>copied and ingested their <strong>sound recordings and musical works</strong> without permission,</li>



<li>used that library to train text-to-music models, and</li>



<li>now offers a commercial product that can spit out tracks resembling their music and style, undermining their licensing revenue.</li>
</ul>



<p>A helpful way to see the structure:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>🎧 Case</th><th>🏛️ Court &amp; Date</th><th>🎼 Who’s Suing</th><th>🎯 Core Allegations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Musicians v. Udio (Uncharted Labs)</td><td>U.S. federal court (filed Oct 15, 2025) </td><td>Group of independent musicians and composers</td><td>Udio allegedly <strong>scraped lyrics sites</strong> and <strong>stream-ripped tracks from platforms like YouTube</strong> to assemble a training corpus of copyrighted songs, without licenses or consent.</td></tr><tr><td>Musicians v. Suno</td><td>U.S. federal court (filed Oct 16, 2025) </td><td>Same musician plaintiffs</td><td>Suno allegedly engaged in similar ingestion of sound recordings and lyrics, then offered a product that can generate music strongly resembling plaintiffs’ works, sometimes when prompted with era/genre/artist-style cues.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The complaints frame this as an attack on “the most vulnerable and valuable creators” in the music ecosystem, not just a technical copyright issue. (<a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/11/28/suno-class-action-lawsuit-join/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Digital Music News</a>)</p>

<p>The pleadings and AI-litigation commentary describe a pipeline that looks roughly like this:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Acquire recordings and lyrics at scale</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Udio is accused of <strong>scraping lyrics websites</strong> and <strong>stream-ripping songs from YouTube</strong> to build a training set of full songs and associated textual metadata. (<a href="https://copyrightalliance.org/copyright-news-october-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Copyright Alliance</a>)</li>



<li>Suno is described in similar terms, with emphasis on ingestion of existing recordings whose rights belong to labels and artists. (<a href="https://www.loevy.com/class-actions/artificial-intelligence/music-ai-class-action/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Loevy + Loevy</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Train text-to-music models</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The models are trained so that a text prompt (genre, era, mood, “in the style of X”) produces full-length audio tracks.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Show ability to mimic existing songs</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Plaintiffs (and their experts) reportedly used <strong>targeted prompts</strong> referring to decade, genre, and artist descriptors; they claim Udio’s and Suno’s outputs <strong>closely resembled specific copyrighted recordings</strong>, sometimes enough to recognize hooks, chord progressions, or production signatures. (<a href="https://www.mckoolsmith.com/newsroom-ailitigation-42?utm_source=chatgpt.com">mckoolsmith.com</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Monetize access</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Both platforms offer free and paid tiers for generating and downloading music; the complaints emphasize that this is not research but <strong>revenue-driven exploitation</strong> of artists’ catalogs. (<a href="https://www.loevy.com/class-actions/artificial-intelligence/music-ai-class-action/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Loevy + Loevy</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Udio’s viral “BBL Drizzy” track and early charting AI songs are background color: they demonstrate that AI-generated tracks can obtain millions of streams and chart placement, which makes the “market harm” argument much more concrete. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udio?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

<p>These lawsuits are not just “you copied our vibe.” They stack several doctrines:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>⚖️ Claim</th><th>💿 What Plaintiffs Allege</th><th>📌 Why It’s Dangerous for AI Music Platforms</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Direct copyright infringement</td><td>Full songs and lyrics were copied into training datasets and stored/processed without license. (<a href="https://copyrightalliance.org/copyright-news-october-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Copyright Alliance</a>)</td><td>Focuses on the <strong>act of ingestion and storage</strong> of recordings, not just outputs. That’s the same weak point that drove Anthropic’s and label lawsuits. (<a href="https://www.riaa.com/record-companies-bring-landmark-cases-for-responsible-ai-againstsuno-and-udio-in-boston-and-new-york-federal-courts-respectively/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">RIAA</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>Contributory / vicarious infringement</td><td>Platforms enable and profit from users generating infringing sound-alikes, and can control the models and filters. (<a href="https://www.mckoolsmith.com/newsroom-ailitigation-42?utm_source=chatgpt.com">mckoolsmith.com</a>)</td><td>Ties liability to <strong>business decisions</strong> about model design and guardrails, not just training.</td></tr><tr><td>DMCA &amp; “stream-ripping”–type violations</td><td>Udio and Suno allegedly bypassed technical measures by ripping songs from streaming platforms and scraping lyric sites. (<a href="https://copyrightalliance.org/copyright-news-october-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Copyright Alliance</a>)</td><td>Raises anti-circumvention and “you didn’t just scrape; you bypassed protections” narratives.</td></tr><tr><td>Right of publicity / privacy (e.g., Illinois)</td><td>Some claims allege unauthorized use of artists’ <strong>voices and personas</strong>, including under the Illinois Right of Publicity Act. (<a href="https://copyrightalliance.org/copyright-news-october-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Copyright Alliance</a>)</td><td>Moves the fight beyond copyright; even licensed compositions/masters might not solve persona-based claims.</td></tr><tr><td>Unjust enrichment &amp; state UDAP claims</td><td>Platforms allegedly saved massive licensing costs and undercut the market for human commissions and licenses. (<a href="https://copyrightalliance.org/copyright-news-october-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Copyright Alliance</a>)</td><td>Sets the stage for <strong>disgorgement</strong> theories tied to platform valuation and revenue.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Unsurprisingly, Suno is already trying to narrow artist suits (including related songwriter cases) by invoking <strong>fair use</strong> and arguing that training on recordings is transformative and socially beneficial. (<a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/suno-pushes-to-narrow-copyright-lawsuit-against-artist-led-group-cites-fair-use-defense/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Music Business Worldwide</a>)</p>



<p>But as with the book cases, the battleground isn’t only fair use. It’s also about:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>whether mass ingestion of complete works crosses qualitative lines, and</li>



<li>whether specific outputs cross into recognizable derivation.</li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_This_Interacts_with_the_Major-Label_Cases_%F0%9F%8E%99%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%8F%A2"></span>How This Interacts with the Major-Label Cases 🎙️🏢<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>These artist-led class actions sit alongside the <strong>major-label lawsuits</strong> brought in 2024 by UMG, Sony, and Warner through the RIAA:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In June 2024, labels sued Suno and Udio, calling them “nothing more than a stealing machine” that built models on vast troves of copyrighted recordings. (<a href="https://www.riaa.com/record-companies-bring-landmark-cases-for-responsible-ai-againstsuno-and-udio-in-boston-and-new-york-federal-courts-respectively/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">RIAA</a>)</li>



<li>By October 2025, <strong>UMG had settled with Udio</strong>, limiting how the platform can operate and reportedly restricting unlicensed models. (<a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/warner-joins-forces-with-ai-song-generator-suno-that-it-was-suing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Pitchfork</a>)</li>



<li>By late November 2025, Warner had reached settlements with both Udio and Suno and pivoted to <strong>licensing deals</strong>, letting artists opt in to have their voices and compositions used in licensed AI models. (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/26/warner-music-signs-deal-with-ai-song-generator-suno-after-settling-lawsuit?utm_source=chatgpt.com">The Guardian</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>So you end up with a two-track system:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Labels</strong> securing corporate-level settlements and licensing frameworks;</li>



<li><strong>Artists</strong> continuing class actions focusing on individual rights and alleged harm to independent musicians’ income and control. (<a href="https://www.loevy.com/class-actions/artificial-intelligence/music-ai-class-action/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Loevy + Loevy</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>That dual structure is important. Even if a platform cuts a deal with the majors, <strong>artist-level litigation can still continue</strong>, especially on right-of-publicity and individual copyright theories.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_This_Matters_If_You_Make_or_Use_AI_Music_%F0%9F%A7%A9"></span>Why This Matters If You Make or Use AI Music 🧩<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>From a practical business perspective, these cases highlight three very immediate risks:</p>



<p><strong>For AI music platforms</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Training on unlicensed recordings and lyrics is now a <strong>known litigation vector</strong>, not a hypothetical.</li>



<li>“We relied on fair use” is being tested in court, but plaintiffs are also attacking the <strong>means of acquisition</strong> (stream-ripping, scraping behind interfaces) and the <strong>closeness of outputs</strong> to existing songs. (<a href="https://copyrightalliance.org/copyright-news-october-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Copyright Alliance</a>)</li>



<li>Even if you settle with labels, you may still be facing <strong>artist and songwriter classes</strong>, as Suno and Udio now are. (<a href="https://www.loevy.com/class-actions/artificial-intelligence/music-ai-class-action/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Loevy + Loevy</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>For labels, publishers, and production companies</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You need contracts that expressly address <strong>AI training, voice/likeness rights, and derivative use</strong>.</li>



<li>You also need an internal policy about when you will <strong>license catalog for AI</strong> and how artists are compensated or allowed to opt out.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>For musicians and composers</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>These cases show that <strong>independent artists can organize</strong> and bring class actions, not just rely on labels.</li>



<li>They also underscore the importance of <strong>copyright registration</strong> and clear ownership of masters and compositions before you start sending demand letters or joining a class. (<a href="https://aristake.com/miss-krystle/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Ari&#8217;s Take</a>)</li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Contract_Fallout_What_Agreements_Need_to_Say_Now_%F0%9F%8E%9B%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%93%9C"></span>Contract Fallout: What Agreements Need to Say Now 🎛️📜<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>On the contracting side, there are at least three buckets that suddenly matter a lot more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>🧾 Agreement Type</th><th>🧠 Key AI-Related Clauses to Revisit</th><th>🎯 Litigation Lesson</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Artist/label &amp; publishing deals</td><td>Explicit grant (or denial) of rights to use <strong>masters and compositions for AI training</strong>, including text-to-music models; clear revenue participation or opt-out mechanisms.</td><td>Without explicit AI language, labels and platforms face arguments that catalog licensing never contemplated this use.</td></tr><tr><td>Sync &amp; commissioned-music contracts</td><td>Clauses specifying whether the commissioner can feed delivered tracks into AI tools (e.g., to generate variants, stems, remixes) and whether the artist’s <strong>voice/timbre</strong> may be modeled.</td><td>Prevents later disputes when clients run tracks through AI to generate “sound-alikes” for new campaigns.</td></tr><tr><td>Platform Terms of Use &amp; License Agreements</td><td>Representations about <strong>training data sources</strong>, DMCA/anti-circumvention compliance, and the extent to which user prompts or outputs are reused for training.</td><td>Udio/Suno complaints make clear that vague ToS plus aggressive ingestion is a litigation magnet. (<a href="https://copyrightalliance.org/copyright-news-october-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Copyright Alliance</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Without these, everyone downstream ends up guessing who actually owns what rights in the AI context.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Demand_Letters_Before_and_After_Filing_%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%8E%BC"></span>Demand Letters Before and After Filing ✉️🎼<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Artist-side law firms are already using <strong>pre-suit demand letters</strong> and sign-up forms to recruit musicians into these cases. (<a href="https://www.loevy.com/class-actions/artificial-intelligence/music-ai-class-action/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Loevy + Loevy</a>)</p>



<p>On the <strong>musician side</strong>, a good pre-litigation letter typically:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>identifies specific recordings and compositions you own;</li>



<li>asks whether and how they were used in training;</li>



<li>reserves rights for both copyright and right-of-publicity claims;</li>



<li>may demand removal from training sets and negotiation of licensing terms.</li>
</ul>



<p>On the <strong>platform side</strong>, receiving such a letter now has to trigger:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>legal hold on training data, logs, and internal testing results;</li>



<li>a careful review of how recordings were actually obtained (licensed catalog vs. YouTube rips vs. “research” sets);</li>



<li>a decision whether to fight on fair use grounds, narrow usage, or shift toward <strong>licensed models</strong> like the ones Suno and Udio are now moving to with Warner/UMG. (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/26/warner-music-signs-deal-with-ai-song-generator-suno-after-settling-lawsuit?utm_source=chatgpt.com">The Guardian</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>Treating these as routine customer complaints is exactly how you end up with a class action filed a week later.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<p>Udio and Suno are not the only AI music platforms in the crosshairs; they’re just early, visible examples.</p>



<p>Between:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the <strong>label suits</strong> pushing toward catalog-licensing deals, and</li>



<li>the <strong>artist-led class actions</strong> attacking unlicensed training and sound-alike outputs,</li>
</ul>



<p>we’re watching the contours of “responsible AI music” being litigated into existence.</p>



<p>The practical message:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you <strong>build</strong> AI music tools, you need a coherent story about where your training data came from and what contracts cover it.</li>



<li>If you <strong>license</strong> music or represent artists, your agreements need explicit AI and training clauses, not generic copyright language.</li>



<li>If you’re a <strong>musician</strong>, you now have a real, concrete roadmap—from demand letters to class actions—for pushing back when your catalog becomes someone’s training set without your consent.</li>
