      <div class="content">
<p>When a meal-kit giant 🍽️ and a regional carwash chain 🚗 both end up in major trouble over automatic renewals, you’re not looking at a fluke. You’re looking at a pattern.</p>



<p>California’s Automatic Renewal Law (ARL) has now produced:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>a $7.5M public-enforcement settlement against HelloFresh, and</li>



<li>a fresh private class action against Soapy Joe’s Carwash for an alleged “automatic renewal scheme.”</li>
</ul>



<p>Same statute, different posture: one is a DA-led case that ended in a consent judgment; the other is a consumer-filed putative class action that’s just beginning. Together, they form a perfect case study in how “subscription traps” turn into investigations, lawsuits, and, very often, demand letters.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="HelloFresh_Californias_%E2%80%9CSubscription_Trap%E2%80%9D_Poster_Child"></span>HelloFresh: California’s “Subscription Trap” Poster Child<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>HelloFresh, the meal-kit subscription company, was hit with a civil enforcement action by a coalition of California prosecutors known as the <strong>California Automatic Renewal Task Force (CART)</strong>. (<a href="https://lacounty.gov/2025/08/18/hellofresh-to-pay-7-5-million-for-deceptive-subscription-practices-in-consumer-protection-lawsuit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Los Angeles County</a>)</p>



<p>CART alleged that HelloFresh:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>failed to clearly and conspicuously disclose key automatic-renewal terms before taking payment,</li>



<li>did not obtain <strong>affirmative consent</strong> to ongoing charges,</li>



<li>provided inadequate post-purchase acknowledgments of the recurring nature of the plan, and</li>



<li>made cancellation difficult, leaving consumers stuck in ongoing charges they did not understand. (<a href="https://lacounty.gov/2025/08/18/hellofresh-to-pay-7-5-million-for-deceptive-subscription-practices-in-consumer-protection-lawsuit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Los Angeles County</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>The case ended in a <strong>$7.5M consent judgment</strong> approved in August 2025:</p>

<p>The injunctive provisions require better disclosures, clearer consent flows, and more straightforward cancellation mechanisms going forward. In other words, CART used one case to send a message to the entire subscription economy: “Clean up your sign-up and cancellation UX, or we’ll make you the next HelloFresh.”</p>

<p>Now shift from meal kits to car washes.</p>



<p>In November 2025, a customer filed <strong>Tate v. Soapy Joe’s, Inc.</strong> in the Southern District of California, a putative class action over Soapy Joe’s monthly car-wash memberships. (<a href="https://www.classaction.org/news/soapy-joes-carwash-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-over-alleged-automatic-renewal-scheme?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ClassAction.org</a>)</p>



<p>The complaint alleges that Soapy Joe’s:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>automatically renewed paid memberships and repeatedly charged customers’ accounts without proper consent,</li>



<li>failed to clearly disclose the automatic-renewal terms, and</li>



<li>made cancellation confusing or difficult, resulting in unwanted ongoing charges. (<a href="https://www.classaction.org/news/soapy-joes-carwash-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-over-alleged-automatic-renewal-scheme?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ClassAction.org</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s framed as an <strong>automatic renewal scheme</strong> and pleads a familiar mix of claims:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>🚗 Soapy Joe’s Case Snapshot</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Forum</td><td>U.S. District Court, S.D. Cal. (Case No. 3:25-cv-03119) (<a href="https://www.classaction.org/news/soapy-joes-carwash-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-over-alleged-automatic-renewal-scheme?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ClassAction.org</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>Who brought it?</td><td>Individual consumer (Maryssa Tate) as representative of a putative class</td></tr><tr><td>Theories</td><td>California ARL, Unfair Competition Law, False Advertising Law, Consumers Legal Remedies Act, and Electronic Funds Transfer Act (<a href="https://www.classaction.org/news/soapy-joes-carwash-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-over-alleged-automatic-renewal-scheme?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ClassAction.org</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>Alleged practices</td><td>Non-conspicuous ARL terms, unauthorized auto-renewal charges, deceptive billing, difficult cancellation</td></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td>Newly filed; no settlement yet, no liability finding</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The complaint also points to consumer complaints on third-party sites (like BBB) as evidence that Soapy Joe’s was on notice of these issues. (<a href="https://www.classaction.org/media/tate-v-soapy-joes-inc-complaint.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ClassAction.org</a>)</p>



<p>Unlike HelloFresh, there is no consent judgment or DA press conference (yet). This is a private enforcement model: consumers and plaintiffs’ firms using ARL, EFT Act, and state consumer-protection statutes to turn small recurring charges into a class-wide federal case.</p>

<p>Put side by side, the two matters show how subscription-law risk arrives from different directions.</p>

<p>For subscription businesses, the lesson is that ARL enforcement is <strong>not just a Big Tech / big-subscription problem</strong>. If a car wash can get dragged into federal court over memberships, any auto-renewing model can.</p>

<p>If you strip away the headlines and look at what CART and plaintiffs’ lawyers are really saying, the same checklist emerges.</p>



<p>In both cases, the accusations boil down to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Did the business clearly and conspicuously tell the consumer that this was a <strong>recurring</strong> charge, not a one-off?</li>



<li>Did the consumer actually <strong>agree</strong> to the recurring nature (affirmative consent) before being billed?</li>



<li>Did the business send a post-transaction acknowledgment that clearly reiterated those terms and cancellation rights?</li>



<li>Was there a <strong>simple cancellation mechanism</strong>, or did consumers have to call, wait on hold, or navigate a labyrinth? (<a href="https://lacounty.gov/2025/08/18/hellofresh-to-pay-7-5-million-for-deceptive-subscription-practices-in-consumer-protection-lawsuit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Los Angeles County</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>HelloFresh is the clean illustration of the public-enforcement side: CART says “no” on all four and secures a consent judgment plus injunctive relief. Soapy Joe’s is the private-enforcement mirror: the complaint pleads those failures as ARL, UCL, FAL, CLRA, and EFT Act violations, and seeks to certify a state-wide class. (<a href="https://www.classaction.org/news/soapy-joes-carwash-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-over-alleged-automatic-renewal-scheme?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ClassAction.org</a>)</p>

<p>Neither HelloFresh nor Soapy Joe’s started with a courtroom. These kinds of disputes almost always begin with:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>customers complaining about unauthorized or confusing charges,</li>



<li>informal cancellation attempts, and</li>



<li>eventually, more formal <strong>demand letters</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>From the consumer side, a well-crafted pre-suit demand does a few important things:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Documents that the company violated ARL-type requirements (clear disclosures, consent, acknowledgments, cancellation).</li>



<li>Ties those technical violations to <strong>real harm</strong>: overdrafts, wasted money, time lost trying to cancel.</li>



<li>Flags exposure to class-wide relief if the pattern appears systemic.</li>



<li>Signals that if the business doesn’t resolve promptly, the next step is a regulatory complaint or a class-action referral.</li>
</ul>



<p>From the business side, ignoring those letters or responding with canned “you agreed to our terms” boilerplate is exactly how you graduate from demand-letter stage to <strong>DA task force</strong> or <strong>putative class action</strong>.</p>



<p>HelloFresh is the cautionary tale on the regulatory side: enough consumer complaints, and your subscription UX becomes the basis for a coordinated multi-county lawsuit. Soapy Joe’s is the cautionary tale on the private side: each unhappy $30/month customer is a future class representative in waiting.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Operational_Lessons_for_Subscription_Businesses"></span>Operational Lessons for Subscription Businesses<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The legal theory is not new. What’s changed is the <strong>enforcement intensity</strong> and the creativity of plaintiffs’ lawyers and DAs in treating these as “subscription traps” rather than annoying billing mistakes. (<a href="https://www.beneschlaw.com/resources/a-dozen-new-lawsuits-and-two-dollar75m-settlements-signal-a-new-era-for-automatic-renewal-compliance.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Benesch Law</a>)</p>



<p>For anyone running an auto-renewing product—SaaS, memberships, subscription boxes, digital services—the HelloFresh v. Soapy Joe’s pattern suggests a few concrete moves.</p>



<p>Think of it as a two-column audit:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>🔍 Question</th><th>Healthy Answer in 2025+</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Are ARL terms clearly visible <em>before</em> payment?</td><td>They are directly on the sign-up page, near the call-to-action, not hidden in a link.</td></tr><tr><td>Do we capture affirmative consent to renewals?</td><td>The UX makes it obvious the plan auto-renews and the user clicks “I agree” to that, not just to the generic terms link.</td></tr><tr><td>Is the post-purchase email crystal clear?</td><td>The receipt/confirmation email restates renewal frequency, price, and how to cancel.</td></tr><tr><td>Can a reasonable person cancel in a couple of clicks?</td><td>There is an online cancellation flow that actually works; no phone-only, fax-only, or “please visit in person” tricks.</td></tr><tr><td>Do we have a paper trail of changes and notices?</td><td>Fee changes, term changes, and all ARL-sensitive updates are tracked and announced in a compliant way.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>If any of these answers are “not really,” you are sitting somewhere on the same spectrum as HelloFresh and Soapy Joe’s—maybe not at the litigation end yet, but on the path.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_These_Two_Cases_Are_a_Warning_Shot_Not_an_Outlier"></span>Why These Two Cases Are a Warning Shot, Not an Outlier<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>HelloFresh’s $7.5M settlement is not random. It is described in commentary as CART’s <strong>largest settlement to date</strong> and part of a wave of new ARL cases and settlements. (<a href="https://www.beneschlaw.com/resources/a-dozen-new-lawsuits-and-two-dollar75m-settlements-signal-a-new-era-for-automatic-renewal-compliance.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Benesch Law</a>)</p>



<p>Soapy Joe’s isn’t a unicorn either. California ARL and related statutes are now routinely used in class actions against:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>streaming services,</li>



<li>SaaS platforms,</li>



<li>gyms and fitness memberships,</li>



<li>subscription boxes and clubs.</li>
</ul>



<p>The combination of relatively small recurring charges, murky disclosures, and friction to cancel is irresistible to both regulators and plaintiffs’ firms. These disputes are also almost perfectly suited for <strong>standardized demand letters and complaints</strong>, because the pattern is so repeatable.</p>



<p>HelloFresh shows what happens when a state task force decides to make an example of you. Soapy Joe’s shows that you don’t need to be a massive public company to become a test case.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<p>Automatic renewals are the lifeblood of modern recurring-revenue businesses. But in 2025 California, they also sit at the intersection of:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>aggressive public enforcement (CART, AG alerts, DA task forces), and</li>



<li>highly repeatable private class actions that can turn a $20/month annoyance into a seven-figure problem.</li>
</ul>



<p>HelloFresh and Soapy Joe’s bookend that spectrum:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the <strong>public case</strong> with a big consent judgment, detailed injunctive terms, and a press blitz, and</li>



<li>the <strong>fresh private case</strong> built on the same statutory backbone, aimed at refunding customers and extracting fees.</li>
</ul>



<p>For lawyers and founders, the message is simple: subscriptions aren’t “set and forget” anymore. They are design problems, compliance problems, and—if you mishandle them—demand-letter problems waiting to happen.</p>
