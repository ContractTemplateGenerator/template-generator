      <h1>Figma and Salesforce Sued Over AI Training DataWhy Your “Friendly SaaS Vendor” Is Suddenly a Data-Rights Adversary 🤖</h1>
      <div class="meta">Published: November 24, 2025 • Dispute Resolution, News, Software</div>
      <div class="content">
<p>Figma and Salesforce are now both defendants in high-profile lawsuits over <strong>how they trained their AI models</strong>—and more importantly, <em>whose data</em> they used to do it.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In Figma’s case, the allegation is that it quietly turned <strong>customer design files</strong> into AI training fuel, despite earlier assurances that it wouldn’t. </li>



<li>In Salesforce’s case, authors say the company used <strong>thousands of pirated books</strong> in datasets like RedPajama and The Pile to train its xGen models, while its CEO publicly criticized other companies for using “stolen data.” </li>
</ul>



<p>If you are a B2B buyer, SaaS founder, or anyone drafting DPAs and AI addenda, these cases are not just tech gossip. They are the <strong>roadmap for your next dispute</strong> if you don’t lock down data rights in your contracts.</p>

<p>Here’s the 10,000-foot comparison:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>🏢 Defendant</th><th>📍 Court &amp; Filing</th><th>📚 What Data Is at Issue</th><th>⚖️ Core Legal Theories</th><th>💣 Why It’s Interesting</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Figma 📐</td><td>N.D. Cal., proposed class action filed Nov. 21, 2025 </td><td>Customer design files, layers, text, images built inside Figma</td><td>Misappropriation of trade secrets, unlawful access, misrepresentation, data privacy violations</td><td>Focuses on <strong>enterprise customer IP</strong>, not public web data; framed heavily as a <em>broken promise / contract</em> story</td></tr><tr><td>Salesforce ☁️</td><td>N.D. Cal., class action filed Oct. 15–16, 2025 </td><td>Thousands of allegedly pirated books in training datasets (RedPajama, The Pile)</td><td>Copyright infringement, DMCA-type theories, unjust enrichment</td><td>Classic “pirated books” fact pattern; juxtaposed with CEO’s public stance against “stolen” AI data</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Both cases sit in the shadow of the <strong>$1.5B Anthropic settlement</strong> with authors whose books were pulled from pirate sites for training data. </p>



<p>The message from plaintiffs’ bar is pretty clear:<br><em>“If Anthropic paid, why not you?”</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Figma_When_%E2%80%9CYour_Files_Stay_Yours%E2%80%9D_Meets_AI_Training_%F0%9F%93%90%F0%9F%A4%96"></span>Figma: When “Your Files Stay Yours” Meets AI Training 📐🤖<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The Figma case (Khan v. Figma Inc.) is notable because it is not about scraping public web content. It’s about what your <strong>paid, logged-in SaaS product</strong> does with the work you create inside it.</p>



<p>According to the complaint and coverage:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Figma allegedly <strong>used customers’ proprietary design files—layouts, components, text, images, layer metadata—to train its generative AI tools</strong> without clear, informed consent. </li>



<li>Plaintiffs say Figma <strong>auto-opted users into AI training</strong>, despite previous statements and marketing suggesting that customer content would <em>not</em> be used that way without permission. </li>



<li>They claim this helped Figma boost its valuation around its 2025 IPO—Reuters mentions a <strong>$1.2B raise</strong> and other reports peg its implied valuation much higher, with plaintiffs arguing the value of customer IP used for training could be “tens or hundreds of billions.” (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/figma-sued-allegedly-misusing-customer-data-ai-training-2025-11-21/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>Figma publicly denies that it trains on customer content without permission and says its policies are being misunderstood. But the complaint is structured to look less like a pure privacy case and more like a mix of <strong>trade secret theft and broken commercial assurances.</strong> (<a href="https://longbridge.com/en/news/267024566?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Longbridge SG</a>)</p>



<p>The key allegation is simple and dangerous:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>You told us our designs were safe and under our control. Then you quietly turned them into training data.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For enterprise design teams shipping confidential product plans through Figma, that’s not a theoretical issue—it’s a <strong>trade-secret threat</strong>.</p>

<p>The Salesforce suit is much closer to the Anthropic / OpenAI line of cases, but with its own twist.</p>



<p>Authors Molly Tanzer and Jennifer Gilmore allege that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Salesforce used <strong>thousands of pirated books</strong>, including theirs, by ingesting datasets like RedPajama and The Pile to train its xGen language models. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/salesforce-sued-by-authors-over-artificial-intelligence-software-2025-10-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</li>



<li>These datasets were assembled from known pirate sources, so the company allegedly <strong>knew or should have known</strong> that they contained unlicensed works.</li>



<li>The suit emphasizes Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff’s prior criticism of AI companies using “stolen” training data and his statements that paying creators would be “easy to do,” painting a picture of corporate hypocrisy. (<a href="https://www.businessinsurance.com/salesforce-sued-by-authors-over-artificial-intelligence-software/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Business Insurance</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>Legally, it’s a straight copyright case with a strong narrative hook:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>📚 Element</th><th>🔍 Plaintiffs’ Framing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Source of works</td><td>“Pirated books” from datasets whose origins are widely discussed in the AI world</td></tr><tr><td>Use</td><td>Downloading, storing, and using full copies to train xGen models</td></tr><tr><td>Ongoing conduct</td><td>Continued storage and processing, not just historical ingestion</td></tr><tr><td>CEO statements</td><td>Benioff’s public stance becomes quasi-admissions about what <em>should</em> be done</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The factual overlap with the Anthropic case (pirate-sourced datasets, authors seeking compensation) makes it easier for plaintiffs to say: <em>“Courts and companies already treat this as wrongful. We just haven’t litigated it against Salesforce yet.”</em> (<a href="https://people.com/after-their-books-were-pirated-to-train-ai-three-authors-went-to-court-and-won-exclusive-11844826?utm_source=chatgpt.com">People.com</a>)</p>

<p>From the customer side, Figma and Salesforce illustrate two different but related problems:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Figma-type risk</strong>: your own proprietary content inside a vendor’s SaaS product is quietly treated as model fuel.</li>



<li><strong>Salesforce-type risk</strong>: your vendor’s model is trained on other people’s allegedly infringing content, and you’re now re-using that model inside your workflows.</li>
</ul>



<p>For a typical enterprise buyer, the real questions are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Can my vendor <strong>train on our data</strong>?</li>



<li>If yes, <strong>for what purposes</strong> (maintenance, product improvement, general model training, resale)?</li>



<li>If their model turns out to be trained on infringing content, who carries the <strong>IP risk downstream</strong>—them or us?</li>
</ul>



<p>Right now, many DPAs and SOWs answer those questions with a vague “we comply with all applicable laws” and a buried reference to the vendor’s online privacy policy. That’s not going to survive this litigation wave.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_Contract_Problem_Data_Rights_Clauses_Stuck_in_the_Pre-AI_Era_%F0%9F%93%9C%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F"></span>The Contract Problem: Data Rights Clauses Stuck in the Pre-AI Era 📜⚙️<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Most legacy SaaS contracts were never written with “model training” in mind. They distinguish between:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Customer Data</strong> (belongs to you, used to provide the service), and</li>



<li><strong>Service Data / Aggregated Data</strong> (usage metrics, logs, etc., used to improve the product).</li>
</ul>



<p>AI training sits awkwardly between those. Vendors increasingly treat training as “improvement of the service.” Customers often view training on their actual content as a separate, licensable use.</p>



<p>Figma and Salesforce are the two archetypes of what happens when that gap is not negotiated clearly.</p>



<p>Here’s how a more AI-aware contract architecture looks:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>🔐 Clause Type</th><th>🧠 What It Should Address</th><th>🧷 Why It Matters in Light of Figma / Salesforce</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Data-Use Grant</td><td>Spell out whether the vendor may use <em>Customer Content</em> (not just logs) for (a) providing the service, (b) improving it, (c) training generalized models.</td><td>Makes it much harder for a vendor to argue “improvement” includes training on your raw creative files or full text.</td></tr><tr><td>Training Opt-In / Opt-Out</td><td>Separate, express consent for model training, ideally with project-level or tenant-level controls.</td><td>Prevents auto-opt-in situations like those alleged in Figma, and gives you a paper trail of choices. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/figma-sued-allegedly-misusing-customer-data-ai-training-2025-11-21/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>Confidential / Trade Secret Protection</td><td>Treat design files, source code, unpublished product plans, etc., as confidential/trade secrets with narrow exceptions.</td><td>Supports misappropriation claims if the vendor re-uses that content in ways never negotiated. (<a href="https://www.prismedia.ai/news/suit-alleges-figma-trained-ai-on-customers-design-files?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Prism Media</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>Third-Party Content Warranties &amp; Indemnity</td><td>Vendor warrants it has rights to training data; indemnifies you against IP claims tied to its models.</td><td>Directly targets Salesforce-type risk: if their model is built on allegedly pirated books, you have a contractual backstop. (<a href="https://www.saverilawfirm.com/our-cases/salesforce-large-language-model-litigation?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Saveri Law Firm</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>Audit / Transparency</td><td>Right to high-level disclosure of training sources (categories, not every file) and to specific info if a claim is asserted.</td><td>Makes it harder for vendors to hide behind “proprietary” training pipelines when you’re on the hook in a third-party suit.</td></tr><tr><td>Sunset / Deletion of Training Data</td><td>Mechanism for demanding deletion or exclusion of your content from future model versions when the contract ends or upon breach.</td><td>Lines up with remedies seen in Anthropic settlement (destroying copies / excluding works from future use). (<a href="https://people.com/after-their-books-were-pirated-to-train-ai-three-authors-went-to-court-and-won-exclusive-11844826?utm_source=chatgpt.com">People.com</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Most customers don’t negotiate all of this. But after Figma and Salesforce, <em>not</em> negotiating it has a clear cost.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_If_You_Suspect_Your_Vendor_Trained_on_Your_Data_Demand_Letters_101_%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F"></span>What If You Suspect Your Vendor Trained on Your Data? Demand Letters 101 ✉️<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>There are two common fact patterns where your next move is a demand letter rather than quiet acceptance:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>You discover, or strongly suspect, that a SaaS vendor used your <strong>proprietary content</strong> (designs, code snippets, documents) to train its model without an explicit grant.</li>



<li>You learn that the vendor’s model itself is under fire (Salesforce-style), and you worry about <strong>downstream liability</strong> for using it in your product or workflow.</li>
</ol>



<p>A well-structured demand letter in this context usually has three jobs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Information</strong> – pin the vendor down on what they did and under what theory.</li>



<li><strong>Preservation</strong> – demand preservation of logs, training data, and contractual history.</li>



<li><strong>Positioning</strong> – reserve your rights and frame this as a breach of contract / misrepresentation / confidentiality issue, not just “hurt feelings.”</li>
</ul>



<p>In a Figma-style scenario, you’re typically focusing on:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>what exactly the contract, ToS, and DPA said about data use;</li>



<li>any <strong>marketing or sales assurances</strong> (“your designs are safe,” “we never train on your files without consent”); (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/figma-sued-allegedly-misusing-customer-data-ai-training-2025-11-21/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</li>



<li>what you want fixed: opt-out of training, separation of your tenant from shared models, deletion of existing training copies where feasible, and potentially monetary compensation if trade secrets were exposed.</li>
</ul>



<p>In a Salesforce-style scenario, the demand may be more defensive:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>do you have <strong>AI IP indemnity</strong> from the vendor;</li>



<li>what representations they made about training sources;</li>



<li>whether they will defend/indemnify you in the event of third-party claims.</li>
</ul>



<p>Either way, these are not “support tickets.” They’re <strong>pre-litigation documents</strong> that will be read later by a judge if things go sideways.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="For_Vendors_Dont_Be_Figma_or_Salesforce_by_Accident_%F0%9F%A7%B1"></span>For Vendors: Don’t Be Figma or Salesforce by Accident 🧱<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>From the vendor side, the instinct is often to keep policies as broad as possible: “we can use your content to improve the service.” That’s understandable. But after these cases, the “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach to training data is starting to look like malpractice.</p>



<p>A more sustainable posture:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Segment training rights.</strong> Treat bug-fixing and maintaining the service differently from training generalized models. Get separate consent.</li>



<li><strong>Align marketing with contracts.</strong> Don’t promise “we never train on your content” if your DPA says you can. That’s essentially the Figma theory in one sentence. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/figma-sued-allegedly-misusing-customer-data-ai-training-2025-11-21/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</li>



<li><strong>Clean your upstream datasets.</strong> If your model relies on datasets like RedPajama or The Pile, you need a real theory of rights, not wishful thinking. Salesforce is being sued precisely because plaintiffs say those datasets were sourced from pirated material. (<a href="https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-faces-lawsuit-from-authors-over-ai-training-data/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Salesforce Ben</a>)</li>



<li><strong>Offer real opt-outs for enterprises.</strong> Many large customers will live with some training use if they can meaningfully opt out where it matters (sensitive projects, regulated data).</li>
</ul>



<p>The alternative is to let plaintiffs’ lawyers, not your product team, decide how your AI stack evolves.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<p>Taken together with Anthropic’s settlement and ongoing suits against Cohere, OpenAI, and others, the Figma and Salesforce cases mark a shift:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Public web scraping is no longer the only flashpoint; <strong>inside-the-app data use</strong> is now front and center. (<a href="https://www.prismedia.ai/news/lawsuits-over-ai-training-data-mount-against-major-tech-platforms?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Prism Media</a>)</li>



<li>The plaintiffs’ bar has a growing <strong>playbook</strong>—pirated datasets for some cases, misrepresented SaaS data practices for others.</li>



<li>Contract lawyers and in-house counsel are suddenly very important in AI risk management, because <strong>data-use rights are now a negotiated economic term</strong>, not boilerplate.</li>
</ul>



<p>If your company builds or buys SaaS and AI, the practical takeaway is straightforward:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Treat data-use clauses, training rights, and AI indemnities as <strong>core deal terms</strong>, not fine print.</li>



<li>Assume that any mismatch between what you say in marketing and what you do in product will be quoted back to you in a complaint.</li>



<li>Have a demand-letter playbook ready—on both offense and defense—before you find your name next to Figma and Salesforce in the next wave of AI-training cases.</li>
