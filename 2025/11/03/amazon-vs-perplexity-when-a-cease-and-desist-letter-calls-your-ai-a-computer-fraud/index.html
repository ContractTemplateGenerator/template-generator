      <div class="content">
<p>Amazon sending a cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity over its Comet AI shopping agent reads like a niche spat between Big Tech and a hot startup.</p>



<p>Underneath it, though, is a very clean, very teachable case study in:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>how to weaponize Terms of Service, computer-fraud theories, and “user experience” into a single high-leverage demand letter;</li>



<li>how quickly a demand letter can escalate into full-blown litigation if the other side refuses to blink; and</li>



<li>what any SaaS/platform/AI company should be doing now to avoid receiving an Amazon-style letter of its own.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_Comet_Is_and_Why_Amazon_Cares"></span>What Comet Is, and Why Amazon Cares<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Perplexity’s <strong>Comet</strong> is an AI-powered browser that lets users delegate web tasks to an “agentic” assistant: it reads, summarizes, and, crucially for this story, <strong>logs into sites and makes purchases on the user’s behalf.</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28browser%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Wikipedia</a>)</p>



<p>For e-commerce, that means a user can say: “Buy me X on Amazon,” and Comet will, using the user’s own credentials stored locally on their device, navigate Amazon, compare options, and complete checkout. Perplexity’s marketing pitch is simple: more convenience, less clicking. (<a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/bullying-is-not-innovation?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Perplexity AI</a>)</p>



<p>Amazon sees something very different:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>automated traffic that does not identify itself as a bot,</li>



<li>a shopping flow that bypasses Amazon’s ad placements and recommendation systems, and</li>



<li>a third party inserting itself between Amazon and “its” customer relationship.</li>
</ul>



<p>Amazon publicly stated that tools like Comet can “significantly degrade the shopping and customer service experience,” and that third-party agents must operate transparently and respect Amazon’s rules. (<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-perplexity-comet-statement?utm_source=chatgpt.com">About Amazon</a>)</p>



<p>That framing is important, because it’s exactly the theme of the cease-and-desist letter.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_Cease-and-Desist_What_Amazon_Actually_Alleged"></span>The Cease-and-Desist: What Amazon Actually Alleged<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>According to coverage of the letter and Amazon’s own statements, the cease-and-desist accuses Perplexity of:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>violating Amazon’s <strong>Terms of Service</strong> by using automated agents (essentially “robots”) to browse and purchase without disclosure, and</li>



<li>engaging in <strong>“computer fraud”</strong> by disguising Comet’s automated activity as if it were human shopping. (<a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/amazon-perplexity-agent-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Futurism</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>Amazon’s standard conditions prohibit “data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools” unless expressly authorized. Comet’s entire value proposition is to act as an autonomous robot that looks like a human in Amazon’s logs. (<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/04/amazon-blocks-perplexity-sending-ai-agents-purchase-goods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">SiliconANGLE</a>)</p>



<p>Amazon also reportedly told Perplexity that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Comet’s behavior <strong>degrades</strong> the customer experience on Amazon,</li>



<li>introduces <strong>privacy and security risks</strong> by funneling traffic through an AI agent, and</li>



<li>had already been the subject of repeated private requests to stop, which Perplexity ignored or circumvented. (<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/04/amazon-blocks-perplexity-sending-ai-agents-purchase-goods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">SiliconANGLE</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>From a demand-letter perspective, this is exactly what you want on the sender’s side: a clear contractual hook, articulated harms that sound bigger than “technical scraping,” and a record of prior warnings.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_Perplexity_Framed_the_Letter_%E2%80%9CBullying_Not_Innovation%E2%80%9D"></span>How Perplexity Framed the Letter: “Bullying, Not Innovation”<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Perplexity answered with a very public blog post titled <strong>“Bullying is not innovation.”</strong> (<a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/bullying-is-not-innovation?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Perplexity AI</a>)</p>



<p>In Perplexity’s telling, the situation looks like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>🧑‍💻 Perplexity’s Story</th><th>📦 Amazon’s Platform</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Users are simply using “their own” AI assistant (Comet) as a personal shopper, just like a human assistant.</td><td>Amazon is being forced to interact with an automated agent it never agreed to and that violates express ToS prohibitions on bots.</td></tr><tr><td>Credentials stay on the user’s device, not on Perplexity’s servers, so there is no new data risk.</td><td>The browsing and purchase flow still comes from an undisclosed automation layer, raising security, integrity, and UX concerns.</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon wants to protect its ad-driven business model and control over upsells, not customers.</td><td>Amazon says this is about transparency, security, and its right to decide which automated agents can transact on its platform.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Perplexity characterizes the letter as an “aggressive legal threat” aimed at preventing users from choosing their own AI assistants, analogizing software to a wrench or an employee: a tool the user has the right to employ. (<a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/bullying-is-not-innovation?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Perplexity AI</a>)</p>



<p>That public response is effectively a counter-narrative to Amazon’s demand letter: instead of quietly complying, Perplexity is trying to re-litigate the framing in the court of public opinion.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="From_Cease-and-Desist_to_Lawsuit_The_Escalation"></span>From Cease-and-Desist to Lawsuit: The Escalation<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Amazon didn’t stop at the demand letter. Within days, it filed suit in federal court (Northern District of California), alleging that Perplexity’s Comet:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>covertly accessed customer accounts,</li>



<li>disguised automated browsing as human activity, and</li>



<li>posed security risks by bypassing Amazon’s safeguards and personalization systems. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/perplexity-receives-legal-threat-amazon-over-agentic-ai-shopping-tool-2025-11-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>Press reports on the complaint quote language that sounds very much like the letter’s rhetoric, including lines to the effect of:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Perplexity’s misconduct must end… that Perplexity’s trespass involves code rather than a lockpick makes it no less unlawful.” (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/perplexity-receives-legal-threat-amazon-over-agentic-ai-shopping-tool-2025-11-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From a demand-letter practice standpoint, this is instructive. The cease-and-desist isn’t just an angry email; it’s the <strong>pre-complaint narrative</strong> that Amazon then copies into its pleading. The allegations, theories, and even the turns of phrase carry over almost verbatim.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Legal_Theories_Hiding_Inside_the_Letter"></span>Legal Theories Hiding Inside the Letter<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The parties haven’t published the full text of the cease-and-desist, but between Amazon’s statement, coverage of the letter, and the subsequent complaint, you can reverse-engineer the main theories. (<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-perplexity-comet-statement?utm_source=chatgpt.com">About Amazon</a>)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>⚖️ Theory / Cause of Action</th><th>💡 How Amazon Uses It in the Narrative</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Breach of Contract (ToS) 📜</td><td>Perplexity’s agents violate explicit prohibitions on robots, data mining, and undisclosed automation.</td></tr><tr><td>Computer Fraud / CFAA 💻</td><td>Automated agent masquerades as human browsing, allegedly “trespassing” into areas Amazon has told it not to access.</td></tr><tr><td>Trespass to Chattels / Interference 🧱</td><td>Automated traffic interferes with Amazon’s systems and the curated shopping experience Amazon built.</td></tr><tr><td>Unfair Competition / Interference with Business Relationships 🧩</td><td>Comet disrupts Amazon’s relationship with its customers and its advertising/personalization revenue streams.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The letter is not trying to win the entire CFAA debate in one shot. It’s doing something narrower and more practical: putting Perplexity on notice that Amazon considers this conduct <em>unlawful access</em> rather than “just another browser,” and that if Perplexity continues, Amazon will tell exactly that story to a judge.</p>



<p>For any platform or SaaS founder, this is a reminder that your <strong>ToS is not just boilerplate</strong>; it is the first exhibit in your demand letter and complaint when you claim someone is misusing your site.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Demand-Letter_Craft_in_Amazons_Approach"></span>Demand-Letter Craft in Amazon’s Approach<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Look at Amazon’s moves through the lens of demand-letter strategy, and a pattern emerges.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Building_the_Record_Before_the_Letter"></span>Building the Record Before the Letter<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Amazon reportedly:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>warned Perplexity repeatedly about Comet’s behavior, including a prior promise by Perplexity to stop,</li>



<li>blocked certain automated access routes, and</li>



<li>made clear (internally and externally) that bots must identify themselves and respect platform rules. (<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/04/amazon-blocks-perplexity-sending-ai-agents-purchase-goods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">SiliconANGLE</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>By the time the cease-and-desist goes out, Amazon can credibly say: “We tried to solve this quietly; you agreed and then circumvented us.” That is powerful context in both a letter and a lawsuit.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Framing_Conduct_as_Both_Technical_and_Human_Harm"></span>Framing Conduct as Both Technical and Human Harm<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>The allegations aren’t limited to “bot bad.” Amazon blends:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>technical infractions (undisclosed automation, violation of robots/data-mining bans);</li>



<li>user harm (degraded recommendations, inaccurate pricing/delivery context, risk of wrong items); and</li>



<li>systemic harm (threatening the integrity of its checkout and personalization systems, which hold immense commercial value). (<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/04/amazon-blocks-perplexity-sending-ai-agents-purchase-goods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">SiliconANGLE</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>That mix makes it easier for Amazon to argue for strong remedies and for a court to see this as more than a petty platform turf war.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Positioning_the_Letter_as_the_Last_Exit_Before_Litigation"></span>Positioning the Letter as the Last Exit Before Litigation<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Given how quickly the lawsuit followed, the cease-and-desist looks less like “let’s see if they’ll talk” and more like “final warning, we’ll file next.”</p>



<p>This is a common pattern in serious commercial disputes: you draft the letter with a view toward (1) being able to attach it to the complaint if you need to, and (2) creating a record that the defendant knowingly proceeded after notice.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_This_Fight_Means_for_Other_Platforms_and_SaaS_Companies"></span>What This Fight Means for Other Platforms and SaaS Companies<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Comet is an extreme example, but the logic applies to far more mundane products:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>browser extensions that auto-add coupons or re-rank products;</li>



<li>price-comparison widgets that ride on top of other stores’ websites;</li>



<li>scraping tools, reseller dashboards, automation scripts that manage multiple accounts;</li>



<li>AI agents that fill carts, manage bookings, or navigate dashboards.</li>
</ul>



<p>Amazon’s message is simple: if you automate interactions with our site in a way we’ve prohibited, hide that automation, and degrade the experience we design, we will treat you as a trespasser and a fraudster, not as “just another client.” (<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/04/amazon-blocks-perplexity-sending-ai-agents-purchase-goods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">SiliconANGLE</a>)</p>



<p>For platforms, that should translate into some concrete action items:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>🏗️ Area</th><th>✅ Healthy Posture After Amazon v. Perplexity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Terms of Use</td><td>Explicit bot/agent clauses, clear disclosure requirements, and reserved rights to block non-compliant automation.</td></tr><tr><td>Technical Controls</td><td>Rate limiting, bot detection, and a plan for handling automated agents that ignore ToS.</td></tr><tr><td>Notice and Takedown</td><td>A defined contact path for agents and integrators who want to be “good citizens”; escalation procedures for those who don’t.</td></tr><tr><td>Communications Playbook</td><td>Template demand letters ready to go when someone crosses the line, plus an internal decision tree for when to escalate to suit.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>If you don’t have those, the Amazon letter is basically a free checklist.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Lessons_for_Businesses_That_Rely_on_AI_Agents"></span>Lessons for Businesses That Rely on AI Agents<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Even on the user side, this fight has implications.</p>



<p>Perplexity’s defense leans hard on the idea that Comet is just “your own assistant” acting on your behalf, with credentials stored locally and no extra data risk. (<a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/bullying-is-not-innovation?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Perplexity AI</a>)</p>



<p>But researchers have already demonstrated serious security issues with agentic browsers, including Comet, such as prompt-injection attacks that trick the agent into leaking credentials or making scam purchases on fake sites. (<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/perplexity-comet-browser-serious-security-flaws?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Windows Central</a>)</p>



<p>If you are a business letting AI agents log into your operational accounts—Amazon, banks, SaaS dashboards—this should worry you on two levels:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Platform risk: the site owner might decide your agent of choice violates its ToS and suddenly block the workflow you rely on.</li>



<li>Security risk: the agent can be manipulated into doing things a human user would spot as malicious immediately.</li>
</ul>



<p>That is precisely the kind of risk profile that leads to demand letters and litigation when something goes wrong.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Takeaways_for_Demand-Letter_and_Contract_Practice"></span>Takeaways for Demand-Letter and Contract Practice<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>From a lawyer’s standpoint, Amazon vs. Perplexity is almost a case study you could hand to associates on “how to draft a high-impact commercial demand in an AI context.”</p>



<p>A few core takeaways:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>ToS is your first weapon.</strong> When you write a company’s online terms, assume you might one day rely on them to call someone’s automated behavior “unauthorized access” or “computer fraud.” Draft accordingly.</li>



<li><strong>Narrative matters as much as doctrine.</strong> Amazon does not rely solely on the fact that its ToS say “no robots.” It paints a story of degraded user experience, privacy risk, and systemic harm—then attaches legal labels (CFAA, trespass, breach) to that story.</li>



<li><strong>Demand letters should be drafted with the complaint in mind.</strong> The language in the subsequent lawsuit strongly echoes the themes in the cease-and-desist, showing that Amazon’s lawyers were already thinking about the pleading when they wrote the letter. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/perplexity-receives-legal-threat-amazon-over-agentic-ai-shopping-tool-2025-11-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</li>



<li><strong>Public counter-narratives are part of the game now.</strong> Perplexity’s decision to respond with a blog titled “Bullying is not innovation” shows that sophisticated recipients will sometimes litigate the optics immediately. Your letter needs to be written with that possibility in mind.</li>
</ul>



<p>For clients on either side—platforms sending letters, startups receiving them—the Amazon–Perplexity clash is a preview of the new normal in AI-driven commerce: demand letters that treat bots as trespassers, ToS as the primary shield and sword, and public messaging as part of the legal strategy rather than an afterthought.</p>
