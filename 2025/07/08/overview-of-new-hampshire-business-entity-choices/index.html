      <h1>Overview Of New Hampshire Business Entity Choices</h1>
      <div class="meta">Published: July 8, 2025 • Incorporation</div>
      <div class="content">


<p>New Hampshire looks small on the map, but its menu of business entities is surprisingly rich. You have the classic workhorses – corporations, LLCs, partnerships and sole proprietorships – plus specialized options like benefit corporations, professional corporations, nonprofit “voluntary corporations,” investment trusts and more.</p>



<p>This guide walks through each option in practical, business-owner language: what it is, who typically uses it, where it shines, and where it can get you into trouble. The focus is not just “what the statute says,” but how these choices actually play out for founders, professionals, investors and small business owners in the Granite State.</p>

<p>At a high level, most for-profit businesses in New Hampshire end up choosing among four families of entities:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Limited liability company (LLC) under RSA 304-C </li>



<li>Business corporation under the New Hampshire Business Corporation Act, RSA 293-A </li>



<li>Benefit corporation under the New Hampshire Benefit Corporation Act, RSA 293-C </li>



<li>Partnerships (general partnership, LP, LLP, sometimes LLLP) that build out of partnership law and are registered with the Secretary of State when they want a liability shield </li>
</ul>



<p>On top of that you have:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Professional corporations and professional LLCs for licensed professions, under RSA 294-A and related rules </li>



<li>Nonprofit / voluntary corporations under RSA 292 </li>



<li>Investment trusts and trust companies for more advanced capital and fiduciary structures </li>
</ul>



<p>The New Hampshire Secretary of State’s office is the gatekeeper for almost all of these filings. Most new entities are now formed online through the QuickStart system. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Sole_Proprietorships_The_Default_You_Might_Regret"></span>Sole Proprietorships: The Default You Might Regret<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>A sole proprietorship is what you have when you are just “doing business as yourself” with no entity filing at all. You can obtain a local business license, open a bank account and operate under your personal name without ever touching the Secretary of State’s website.</p>



<p>That simplicity is both the attraction and the danger.</p>



<p>✅ Good fit when</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You are testing out a very small, low-risk side gig (for example, tutoring or simple online freelancing) and you are comfortable that lawsuit and debt exposure is minimal.</li>
</ul>



<p>❌ Poor fit when</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You are signing leases, hiring employees, offering professional advice, or dealing with significant customer or investor money. In all those cases a sole proprietorship leaves your house, savings and personal wages exposed to business creditors.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to use a brand name instead of your personal name, you register a trade name (often called a “DBA”) with the state. That registration does not create any liability shield; it simply puts other businesses on notice that you are using that name.</p>



<p>Example:<br>Emma starts “Emma’s Houseplants” by selling a few plants a month from her apartment in Manchester. At first she just uses Venmo and her own name. Once she starts shipping larger orders and leasing a greenhouse space, staying a sole proprietor becomes risky; a single slip-and-fall or contract dispute could put her personal assets on the line. That is the natural point to upgrade to an LLC or corporation.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="General_Partnerships_LPs_LLPs_And_LLLPs"></span>General Partnerships, LPs, LLPs And LLLPs<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>If two or more people go into business together without forming an entity, New Hampshire law will usually treat them as a general partnership.</p>



<p>In a general partnership, every partner is an owner, a manager and a personal guarantor of the partnership’s debts. That is nowhere near as popular as it used to be, because New Hampshire gives you relatively easy access to LLCs and LLPs.</p>



<p>Limited partnerships (LPs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) plug some of those gaps:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A <strong>limited partnership (LP)</strong> has at least one general partner (who manages and has unlimited liability) and one or more limited partners (who usually contribute capital and enjoy limited liability). LPs and LLPs in New Hampshire file a Certificate of Partnership with the Secretary of State and renew annually. </li>



<li>A <strong>limited liability partnership (LLP)</strong> is basically a general partnership that has filed for LLP status, turning partners’ liability for partnership debts into something more limited and fault-based.</li>
</ul>



<p>New Hampshire allows an LP to elect “limited liability limited partnership” (LLLP) status in line with the modern uniform acts, so you can have an LP-style capital structure while still protecting the general partners with a liability shield.</p>



<p>✅ Good fit when</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You have several experienced professionals or investors who want tax partnership treatment and are comfortable with a partnership agreement that reads more like a mini-constitution than a two-page contract.</li>



<li>You are structuring a real-estate fund or investment vehicle where LP/LLLP structures are familiar to investors.</li>
</ul>



<p>❌ Poor fit when</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You and your co-founder are tech or service entrepreneurs who just want flexible management and clean liability protection; an LLC will usually be much more straightforward.</li>



<li>No one on the team wants to maintain a detailed partnership agreement or track capital accounts year after year.</li>
</ul>



<p>Example:<br>Three real-estate investors form Granite Peak Capital, LLLP, to hold a portfolio of apartment complexes. Two of them are limited partners who contribute most of the capital. The third is a general partner in charge of acquisitions and management, but because the LP has elected LLLP status, even the general partner enjoys a statutory liability shield, subject to usual exceptions for personal misconduct.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Limited_Liability_Companies_LLCs_Under_RSA_304-C"></span>Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) Under RSA 304-C<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>For most small and medium-sized businesses in New Hampshire, the LLC is the workhorse entity of choice. New Hampshire’s LLC statute, RSA 304-C, treats the LLC as an unincorporated entity that can combine corporate-style asset protection with partnership-style flexibility. (<a href="https://www.mclane.com/insights/limited-liability-companies-in-new-hampshire/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">McLane Middleton</a>)</p>



<p>A New Hampshire LLC is formed by filing a Certificate of Formation (Form LLC-1) with the Secretary of State and paying the filing fee. (<a href="https://www.sos.nh.gov/corporations-0/forms-and-fees/limited-liability-companies?utm_source=chatgpt.com">New Hampshire Secretary of State</a>) The LLC’s name must include “Limited Liability Company,” “LLC,” or similar wording.</p>



<p>Key features:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Liability shield: Members are not personally liable for company debts by virtue of being members.</li>



<li>Flexible management: You can choose “member-managed” (owners run the company) or “manager-managed” (appointed managers run it). (<a href="https://www.sos.nh.gov/corporations-0/business-faqs?utm_source=chatgpt.com">New Hampshire Secretary of State</a>)</li>



<li>Flexible taxation: By default, a one-member LLC is disregarded for federal tax purposes; a multi-member LLC is treated as a partnership. In either case you can elect corporate or S-corporation tax treatment if that suits your situation.</li>



<li>Contract-driven: The operating agreement, rather than rigid corporate bylaws, does most of the heavy lifting.</li>
</ul>



<p>✅ Typically a strong fit for</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Owner-managed operating businesses (retail, online stores, marketing agencies, trades, restaurants, consulting, software).</li>



<li>Rental real-estate holding companies that want separate “buckets” of liability for each property.</li>



<li>Joint ventures between two companies where both parties want negotiated control and economics.</li>
</ul>



<p>❌ Potentially a weaker fit when</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You plan to scale into a high-growth, venture-backed C-corp in the near term. Converting is possible, but you may prefer to start life as a corporation if that is clearly the path.</li>



<li>You want to offer incentive stock options or tap into the full equity comp toolbox that investors and employees are used to seeing in Delaware C-corps.</li>
</ul>



<p>Example:<br>Two software developers in Portsmouth launch “HarborWave Analytics LLC,” with one focused on sales and the other on engineering. They use a member-managed LLC with a detailed operating agreement allocating profits 60/40, setting vesting for their equity interests, and giving the sales-focused founder tie-breaking authority over marketing spend. As the company grows, they can later elect S-corp tax status for payroll-tax optimization, or convert into a corporation if a venture investor requires it.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Professional_LLCs_And_Professional_Corporations"></span>Professional LLCs And Professional Corporations<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>New Hampshire uses a dedicated statute, RSA 294-A, to govern professional corporations – entities that provide licensed professional services such as law, medicine, architecture or accounting. (<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-hampshire/title-xxvii/chapter-294-a/section-294-a-1/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Justia Law</a>)</p>



<p>A <strong>professional corporation (PC)</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Is formed under RSA 294-A with Articles of Incorporation that state the professional services to be rendered. (<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-hampshire/title-xxvii/chapter-294-a/section-294-a-1/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Justia Law</a>)</li>



<li>Must have shareholders, directors and certain officers who are “qualified persons” – typically individuals or entities properly licensed in that profession. (<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-hampshire/title-xxvii/chapter-294-a/section-294-a-1/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Justia Law</a>)</li>



<li>Uses a name that ends in “Professional Corporation,” “P.C.,” or a similar authorized ending. (<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-hampshire/2023/title-xxvii/chapter-294-a/section-294-a-7/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Justia Law</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>New Hampshire also allows professional services through LLCs, often organized as professional LLCs (PLLCs). Regulatory boards and practice-of-medicine guidance recognize both PCs and LLCs as acceptable vehicles as long as ownership and control follow licensing rules. (<a href="https://www.permithealth.com/post/new-hampshire-corporate-practice-of-medicine-cpom-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com">permithealth.com</a>)</p>



<p>✅ Good fit when</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You run a medical practice, law firm, accounting firm or other licensed practice with multiple owners and you want clear professional-entity compliance.</li>



<li>Your licensing board prefers or strongly expects professional entities.</li>
</ul>



<p>❌ Poor fit when</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You are running a non-licensed consulting business. A standard LLC or corporation is usually simpler.</li>
</ul>



<p>Example:<br>A group of three orthopedic surgeons in Concord create “Granite Orthopedics, P.C.” under RSA 294-A. All shareholders and directors are New Hampshire-licensed physicians. They lease office space, hire nurses and physician assistants, and bill insurers. The PC structure reinforces that professional decision-making stays in the physicians’ hands, even if they later partner with a hospital system as an “MSO + PC” arrangement.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Business_Corporations_Under_RSA_293-A"></span>Business Corporations Under RSA 293-A<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The New Hampshire Business Corporation Act, RSA 293-A, is the backbone statute for standard for-profit corporations. </p>



<p>To form a corporation, you file Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State and pay the fee. (<a href="https://www.sos.nh.gov/corporations-0/forms-and-fees/domestic-and-foreign-corporation?utm_source=chatgpt.com">New Hampshire Secretary of State</a>) The statute covers everything from share structure and distributions to director duties, mergers and share exchanges. </p>



<p>Within this framework you can have:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A traditional “C-corp” (for federal tax purposes).</li>



<li>An S-corporation, which is simply a qualifying corporation that has made a Subchapter S election with the IRS (and meets the shareholder and single-class-of-stock requirements).</li>
</ul>



<p>✅ Good fit when</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You know you are aiming for venture capital or other institutional investors who expect a C-corp structure.</li>



<li>You want to issue different classes of stock (voting, non-voting, preferred) and build out a classic capital stack with convertible notes, SAFEs, options and warrants.</li>
</ul>



<p>❌ Less ideal when</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You are a solo or two-person service business that wants minimal formalities; an LLC will usually be easier.</li>



<li>You are highly focused on pass-through taxation but don’t want the restrictions of S-corps (for example, foreign shareholders, multiple classes of equity).</li>
</ul>



<p>Example:<br>A robotics startup in Nashua forms “NorthRiver Robotics, Inc.” under RSA 293-A with 10 million authorized shares of common stock and a standard Delaware-style option pool. When they raise a seed round from a Boston venture fund, the investors are comfortable slotting their preferred stock and protective provisions into the familiar corporate template.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Benefit_Corporations_And_Professional_Benefit_Corporations"></span>Benefit Corporations And Professional Benefit Corporations<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>New Hampshire adopted the Benefit Corporation Act (RSA 293-C), creating a special kind of for-profit corporation that is required to pursue a “general public benefit” and may specify additional specific public benefits in its articles. </p>



<p>A benefit corporation:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Is formed by complying with the standard incorporation provisions of RSA 293-A and adding a clear statement in the articles that it is a benefit corporation. (<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-hampshire/title-xxvii/chapter-293-c/section-293-c-3/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Justia Law</a>)</li>



<li>May use “PBC” as a corporate designator. (<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-hampshire/title-xxvii/chapter-293-c/section-293-c-3/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Justia Law</a>)</li>



<li>Requires directors to consider not only shareholder pecuniary interests, but also the impact of their decisions on stakeholders and the public benefit purposes.</li>
</ul>



<p>New Hampshire even allows <strong>professional benefit corporations</strong>, combining professional-entity restrictions with the benefit-corporation overlay. </p>



<p>✅ Strong fit when</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your brand and mission are explicitly social or environmental (for example, a renewable-energy developer, social-impact consulting firm, or mission-driven consumer brand) and you want the corporate documents to reflect that.</li>



<li>You anticipate investors or employees asking for a formalized commitment to impact beyond profit.</li>
</ul>



<p>❌ Potential misfit when</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your investors want maximum flexibility to pivot the business model without worrying about stakeholder-interest language in director duties.</li>



<li>You do not plan to publish or maintain impact reports; the added compliance becomes more burden than benefit.</li>
</ul>



<p>Example:<br>A sustainable packaging company in Keene forms as “EverGreen Packaging PBC.” Its articles state that it exists to reduce single-use plastics in New England supply chains. When evaluating a lucrative contract that would require relaxing its environmental standards, the board has clear statutory guidance to weigh environmental and community impact alongside shareholder returns.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Nonprofit_And_Voluntary_Corporations"></span>Nonprofit And Voluntary Corporations<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>New Hampshire’s charitable and membership nonprofits generally organize under RSA 292, the Voluntary Corporations and Associations statute. (<a href="https://www.sos.nh.gov/corporations-0/forms-and-fees/nonprofit-corporations-and-associations?utm_source=chatgpt.com">New Hampshire Secretary of State</a>)</p>



<p>Formally, these entities are still “corporations,” but they operate without shareholders. Instead there may be members, a self-perpetuating board, or a hybrid structure. Common examples:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Charitable organizations (food banks, animal shelters, educational nonprofits)</li>



<li>Trade and industry associations</li>



<li>Youth sports leagues and hobby clubs</li>



<li>Religious organizations that choose corporate form rather than purely unincorporated association</li>
</ul>



<p>The Attorney General’s Charitable Trusts Unit keeps a close eye on charitable nonprofits, especially those that solicit public donations.</p>



<p>✅ Good fit when</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your primary purpose is charitable, religious, educational or civic, and you do not intend to distribute profits to private owners.</li>



<li>You need limited liability for directors and officers, continuity of existence and the ability to own property as a legal person.</li>
</ul>



<p>❌ Not the right vehicle when</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Founders expect to extract profits as owners or sell the organization later. Nonprofit assets are locked into charitable or member-benefit purposes.</li>
</ul>



<p>Example:<br>Five local parents form “North Country Robotics Club, Inc.” as a voluntary corporation to run youth robotics programs in the North Country. There are no shareholders, only members and a board. Any surplus revenue goes back into equipment, scholarships and events, not into dividends.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Investment_Trusts_And_Trust_Companies"></span>Investment Trusts And Trust Companies<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>New Hampshire is nationally known for its trust and wealth-planning environment. On the business-entity side, two structures occasionally surface in business planning:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Investment trusts</strong> – governed by specific statutes and SOS procedures (with domestication mechanics in RSA 293-B). (<a href="https://www.sos.nh.gov/corporations-0/forms-and-fees/new-hampshire-investment-trusts?utm_source=chatgpt.com">New Hampshire Secretary of State</a>)</li>



<li><strong>Trust companies</strong> – heavily regulated entities authorized to act as professional trustees and fiduciaries under modern trust-company laws. (<a href="https://www.gcglaw.com/knowledge-center/a-first-look-at-new-hampshires-new-trust-company-laws?utm_source=chatgpt.com">gcglaw.com</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>These are not typical operating entities for a bakery or software startup, but they matter if you are structuring a private trust company, family office or pooled investment vehicle with a New Hampshire nexus.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Frequently_Asked_Questions_About_New_Hampshire_Entity_Types"></span>Frequently Asked Questions About New Hampshire Entity Types<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Can I form my New Hampshire LLC or corporation from outside the state?</p>



<p>Yes. New Hampshire law does not require owners, directors or managers of an LLC or corporation to reside in the state. Many businesses are formed by non-resident owners who either operate remotely or hire local staff. The key in that case is to appoint and maintain a New Hampshire registered agent with a physical address where legal papers can be served. Once you are operating, you still need to comply with whatever licensing, employment and tax rules apply to your line of business, even if you personally live in another state.</p>



<p>A common pattern is a Massachusetts or Vermont entrepreneur forming a New Hampshire entity for a project that will operate physically in New Hampshire (for example, a campground or manufacturing facility). The home-state tax impact, foreign-qualification requirements and cross-border issues then need to be modeled along with entity choice.</p>



<p>Do New Hampshire LLCs and corporations really protect my personal assets?</p>



<p>When properly formed and operated, they provide a powerful liability shield – but not an absolute one. The statutes are clear that members of an LLC or shareholders of a corporation are not personally liable for the entity’s obligations solely because of their ownership interest. </p>



<p>However, three practical limits matter:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Personal guarantees and co-signing. If you personally guarantee a lease, bank loan or supplier credit, the creditor can pursue you even if the LLC fails.</li>



<li>Piercing the veil. Courts can disregard the entity in extreme cases of undercapitalization, commingling of funds, fraud or failure to respect basic formalities.</li>



<li>Personal misconduct. Professional malpractice, intentional torts and other personal wrongdoing are usually not insulated by the entity.</li>
</ol>



<p>The takeaway is that forming the entity is step one; maintaining clean books, separate bank accounts, proper contracts and reasonable capitalization are step two.</p>



<p>Is a New Hampshire LLC or S-corporation better for tax purposes?</p>



<p>For many small businesses, the real comparison is “LLC taxed as partnership or disregarded” versus “LLC or corporation taxed as an S-corp.” The legal form and the tax classification are related but distinct levers.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A default LLC taxed as a sole proprietorship or partnership offers maximum flexibility in allocating profits, losses and basis among members.</li>



<li>An S-corporation can reduce self-employment taxes if the owners pay themselves a reasonable salary and take additional profits as distributions not subject to FICA.</li>
</ul>



<p>New Hampshire’s own tax system also plays a role: the Business Profits Tax (BPT) and Business Enterprise Tax (BET) apply to many entities regardless of federal form. A detailed modeling exercise with both legal and tax advisors is often justified once profits reach a meaningful level.</p>



<p>If you know from day one that you will want S-corp taxation, you can either form a corporation and elect S-status or form an LLC and later elect to have it treated as an S-corp for tax only. The operating agreement or bylaws should anticipate that shift.</p>



<p>What is the practical difference between a benefit corporation and a standard corporation in New Hampshire?</p>



<p>On paper, they share the same corporate DNA. A benefit corporation is formed under the Business Corporation Act and files similar documents, but its articles add an explicit statement that it is a benefit corporation under RSA 293-C and, often, one or more specific public benefits it intends to pursue. (<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-hampshire/title-xxvii/chapter-293-c/section-293-c-3/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Justia Law</a>)</p>



<p>In practice, three things change:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fiduciary lens.</strong> Directors are expected to consider the effects of decisions on stakeholders (employees, customers, community, environment) and the stated public benefits, not just on shareholders.</li>



<li><strong>Transparency.</strong> Many benefit corporations adopt reporting practices about their social and environmental performance, sometimes using third-party standards.</li>



<li><strong>Brand and deal signaling.</strong> The “PBC” suffix and statutory framework signal to employees, customers and investors that mission considerations are formally embedded, which can be an asset in recruiting and branding but can also narrow your investor universe.</li>
</ul>



<p>Investors who care primarily about impact may prefer benefit corporations. Investors focused purely on financial return may be indifferent or may prefer a plain C-corp to avoid ambiguity in fiduciary duties.</p>



<p>Do New Hampshire professional corporations and professional LLCs change malpractice risk?</p>



<p>Professional entities do not erase individual malpractice exposure. A physician, lawyer or accountant whose own negligence causes harm remains personally liable for that malpractice. What the entity does is:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Protect innocent co-owners from being personally responsible for each other’s malpractice, beyond their investment in the entity.</li>



<li>Provide corporate-style continuity, branding, retirement and buy-in/buy-out mechanics that are much harder to organize in a simple partnership.</li>
</ul>



<p>Regulators and licensing boards will often specify who may own shares or membership interests and what happens if a professional owner loses a license or dies. Those rules need to be baked into the shareholder agreement or operating agreement.</p>



<p>Can I convert my New Hampshire LLC to a corporation later if investors ask for it?</p>



<p>Yes. Modern statutes contemplate mergers, conversions and share exchanges between LLCs, corporations and other “eligible entities.” (<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-hampshire/title-xxvii/chapter-293-a/section-293-a-11-03/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Justia Law</a>)</p>



<p>A typical path is:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Adopt a plan of conversion or merger (LLC into corporation).</li>



<li>File the required conversion or merger documents with the Secretary of State.</li>



<li>Treat LLC membership interests as exchanging into corporate shares under the agreed-upon conversion ratio.</li>
</ol>



<p>For small owner-managed businesses, this can often be handled with carefully drafted documents and minimal tax friction if structured before a large appreciation event. Once significant value has built up, tax considerations become more complex and need to be modeled carefully.</p>



<p>Are New Hampshire nonprofit corporations allowed to engage in revenue-generating activities?</p>



<p>Yes, within limits. A New Hampshire voluntary corporation under RSA 292 can run revenue-generating programs, charge fees and even operate side businesses, as long as the overall activity and use of funds support its nonprofit purposes. (<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-hampshire/title-xxvii/chapter-292/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Justia Law</a>)</p>



<p>The constraints come from:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>State nonprofit law (no private inurement, proper board governance, adherence to stated purposes).</li>



<li>Federal tax law, if the organization pursues or maintains 501(c)(3) or other exempt status, including private-benefit restrictions and unrelated business income tax.</li>
</ul>



<p>It is now common, for example, for a New Hampshire educational nonprofit to run a café, thrift shop or ticketed events to support its mission. The key is to structure contracts, employment, and related-party transactions so that insiders are not siphoning off value and the revenue track is properly accounted for.</p>



<p>Is an LLP or LLLP still relevant if LLCs are so flexible?</p>



<p>In New Hampshire, LLCs have indeed captured most of the “small business with liability shield” market. That said, LLPs and LLLPs still matter in certain niches:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Established law or accounting firms that historically operated as partnerships and prefer to keep partnership-style governance while adding a liability shield.</li>



<li>Investment funds where the sponsor and investors are used to LP dynamics (capital accounts, carried interest, special allocations) and see no reason to rewrite the playbook.</li>
</ul>



<p>For a typical new consulting firm, marketing agency or local contractor, it is usually more intuitive to implement those economic and governance arrangements inside an LLC operating agreement than to maintain a full-blown limited partnership with an LLLP election.</p>



<p>What should foreign (non-U.S.) founders know about forming entities in New Hampshire?</p>



<p>Foreign entrepreneurs can form and own New Hampshire entities, but there are a few unique wrinkles:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Federal “E-2” treaty investor or “L-1” intracompany transferee visas may interact with entity choice, especially if the New Hampshire entity is meant to qualify as the sponsoring enterprise.</li>



<li>Some U.S. tax elections (for example, S-corporation status) are not available if there are non-resident alien shareholders.</li>



<li>Banking, KYC and anti-money-laundering rules may make it easier to work with entities that have transparent ownership and U.S.-based officers.</li>
</ul>



<p>For many foreign founders, the main choice is whether New Hampshire is the right incorporation jurisdiction at all, or whether they should form in Delaware and qualify the company to do business in New Hampshire as a foreign entity. That decision is driven by investor expectations, corporate governance preferences and where the bulk of operations will sit.</p>



<p>How do New Hampshire trust companies and investment-trust structures fit into business planning?</p>



<p>Most operating businesses will never need to think about RSA 383-C trust companies or investment-trust domestication rules. Those regimes are highly specialized and sit at the intersection of banking, securities and fiduciary law. (<a href="https://www.gcglaw.com/knowledge-center/a-first-look-at-new-hampshires-new-trust-company-laws?utm_source=chatgpt.com">gcglaw.com</a>)</p>



<p>They become relevant when:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A wealthy family wants to charter its own private trust company in New Hampshire to serve as trustee for family trusts.</li>



<li>An investment sponsor wants to use an investment-trust form for pooled investment products that will be administered from New Hampshire.</li>
</ul>



<p>Those structures need bespoke regulatory and tax analysis, and are not simply “another way to form an LLC.”</p>
