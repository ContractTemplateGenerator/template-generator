      <div class="meta">Published: July 4, 2025 • Contractors &amp; Employees</div>
      <div class="content">
<p>Remote work, GitHub at night, a little SaaS on the side… and somewhere in HR’s SharePoint there’s a “Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement” you clicked through on day one.</p>



<p>This is the collision point:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>You feel like “it’s my side project.”<br>Your employer assumes “we own anything you build while you work here.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This article walks through how ownership of employee side projects actually works in the U.S., with matrices you can adapt into policies, NDAs, or onboarding docs.</p>

<p>Most “who owns my side project?” analysis reduces to three overlapping pieces:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>🧩 Type of Right</th><th>What It Covers In Side Projects</th><th>Default Rule (Without Any Contract)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Copyright</strong></td><td>Code, UI, text, designs, training data, documentation, content.</td><td>Creator is the owner <strong>unless</strong> (1) it’s a “work made for hire” (within scope of employment) or (2) rights are assigned. (<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ30.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">U.S. Copyright Office</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Patents</strong></td><td>Patentable inventions: new software methods, hardware designs, processes.</td><td>The <strong>inventor</strong> owns the patent rights unless there’s an assignment or duty to assign; the employer may only get an implied license. </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Contract (invention assignment)</strong></td><td>“PIIAA” style agreements that say: you assign certain inventions to the employer.</td><td>Often drafted very broadly; their enforceability is then limited by state law (e.g., California Labor Code 2870). )</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>You only really answer “who owns my app?” once you’ve walked through all three.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="%F0%9F%A7%91%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%92%BB_Work_Made_For_Hire_vs_True_%E2%80%9CSide_Project%E2%80%9D"></span>🧑‍💻 Work Made For Hire vs True “Side Project”<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The phrase “work made for hire” gets thrown around a lot in tech, often incorrectly.</p>



<p>Under U.S. copyright law, a work is “made for hire” if: (<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ30.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">U.S. Copyright Office</a>)</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You’re an <strong>employee</strong>, <em>and</em></li>



<li>You created the work <strong>within the scope of your employment</strong> (the kind of thing you’re paid to do, on your employer’s time, for their benefit),</li>
</ul>



<p>or (less common here) it’s a specifically commissioned work in one of a few narrow categories with a written “work for hire” agreement.</p>



<p>Applied to side projects:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Work-For-Hire Likely?</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>You’re a software engineer building an internal tool during your normal workday at your employer, under a ticket assigned to you.</td><td>🟢 Yes</td><td>That code is almost certainly owned by the employer as work made for hire.</td></tr><tr><td>You’re the same engineer building an unrelated mobile game at home at night, not using company resources.</td><td>🔴 Usually no</td><td>It’s outside scope of employment; default copyright stays with you (subject to any contract/2870 issues). )</td></tr><tr><td>Marketing employee writing a fantasy novel on weekends.</td><td>🔴 No</td><td>Completely outside role and business.</td></tr><tr><td>Product designer prototyping a SaaS UX that’s close to employer’s roadmap, using Figma on work laptop during “down” time.</td><td>🟡 Gray</td><td>Scope-of-employment + employer devices + relation to business all cut against “pure side project.”</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>So: <strong>work-for-hire is a narrow doctrine</strong>, but when it applies, the employer is the initial copyright owner even before any contract.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="%F0%9F%93%9C_Invention_Assignment_Agreements_The_Real_Battleground"></span>📜 Invention Assignment Agreements: The Real Battleground<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Most tech employers don’t rely solely on work-for-hire. They use <strong>Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreements</strong> (PIIAA) that say, in effect:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“You assign to us any inventions you create during your employment that relate to our business, or that you create using our equipment or confidential information.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In many states, broad assignment clauses like that are enforceable unless limited by <strong>specific statutes</strong>.)</p>



<p>But a subset of states now have <strong>employee-protection laws</strong> that carve out side projects.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="%F0%9F%97%BA%EF%B8%8F_State_%E2%80%9CEmployee_Invention%E2%80%9D_Laws_The_Side-Project_Shield"></span>🗺️ State “Employee Invention” Laws: The Side-Project Shield<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Several states follow a California-style approach: certain employee inventions must <strong>not</strong> be swept into assignment clauses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="California_the_template"></span>California (the template)<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>California Labor Code § 2870 says an employee’s agreement to assign inventions <strong>does not apply</strong> to any invention the employee: (<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/california/code-lab/division-3/chapter-2/article-3-5/section-2870/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Justia Law</a>)</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Developed <strong>entirely on their own time</strong>,</li>



<li><strong>Without using employer equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secrets</strong>,</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>except</strong> if the invention:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Relates to the employer’s business or actual/anticipated R&amp;D, or</li>



<li>Results from work performed for the employer.</li>
</ol>



<p>Employers must also <strong>give employees written notice</strong> of these limits (2871–2872) and often attach a statutory notice. (<a href="https://cdn-static.findly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/1379/2021/03/TILAW-334531-v3-CA_Assignment_of_Inventions_02_18_Revisions1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cdn-static.findly.com</a>)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Other_states"></span>Other states<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Illinois, Washington, Minnesota, North Carolina, Delaware, New York and others have similar statutes limiting forced assignment of <em>truly independent</em> inventions. (<a href="https://www.ilga.gov/Legislation/ILCS/Articles?ActID=2238&amp;ChapterID=62&amp;Print=True&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com">Illinois General Assembly</a>)</p>



<p>Common pattern:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No assignment where invention is developed on the employee’s own time,</li>



<li>Without employer resources or trade secrets,</li>



<li>And <strong>not related</strong> to the employer’s business or actual/expected R&amp;D.</li>
</ul>



<p>So even if your PIIAA reads “we own everything you ever think about,” state law can make those parts <strong>void and unenforceable</strong> for qualifying side projects.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="%F0%9F%A7%AE_Side_Project_Ownership_Matrix"></span>🧮 Side Project Ownership Matrix<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Here’s a visual decision matrix you can adapt. It assumes you’re in a state with a California-style statute; if not, the contract may have more reach.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>🎯 Side Project Scenario</th><th>Own Time?</th><th>Employer Resources?</th><th>Related To Employer’s Business?</th><th>Who Likely Owns?*</th><th>Risk Level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Indie game, built on your own laptop at home, no overlap with employer’s business.</td><td>✅ Yes</td><td>❌ No</td><td>❌ No</td><td><strong>You</strong> by default.

Very hard for employer to claim.</td><td>🟢 Low</td></tr><tr><td>AI tool that directly competes with employer’s future roadmap, drafted using employer’s confidential strategy deck.</td><td>❌ No</td><td>✅ Yes</td><td>✅ Obvious</td><td>Employer likely owns or, at minimum, has strong claims (trade secrets, fiduciary duties).</td><td>🔴 Very High</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>* “Who owns” here is shorthand; real outcomes depend on jurisdiction, contract language, and evidence.</p>

<li>“If you used our laptop, GitHub account, or confidential info, it’s ours (or at least we get a license).”</li>
</ul>



<p>Both sides are partially right.</p>



<p>Legally:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Default patent rule:</strong> inventor owns rights unless there’s an assignment; employer may get an <strong>implied license</strong> for inventions created in the course of duties. (<a href="https://sierraiplaw.com/employee-invention/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Sierra IP Law</a>)</li>



<li><strong>Default copyright rule:</strong> creator owns, unless work-for-hire or assigned. (<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ30.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">U.S. Copyright Office</a>)</li>



<li><strong>Contract + state statutes</strong> then shift that default up to a point.</li>

<p>In California and similar states, the more you can tick those boxes, the stronger your position under Labor Code 2870–style protections. (<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/california/code-lab/division-3/chapter-2/article-3-5/section-2870/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Justia Law</a>)</p>

<p>For multi-state employers, you also have to bolt on <strong>state-specific notices</strong> (CA, IL, WA, MN, NY, etc.) to assignment clauses, or you risk parts of them being void. </p>

<p>Modern wrinkle: side projects now often rely on <strong>AI coding assistants</strong> and AI content models.</p>



<p>Key questions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you use your employer’s <strong>enterprise AI tooling</strong> (e.g., code assistant tied to their repos), you’re implicitly pulling in their IP and training data. Expect them to argue that outputs are part of their ecosystem.</li>



<li>If you use <strong>consumer AI tools</strong> on employer confidential information (internal docs, private code), you may both:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Breach your PIIAA / confidentiality obligations, and</li>



<li>Expose employer trade secrets into third-party AI logs or training corpora. (<a href="https://rpjlaw.com/how-to-safeguard-intellectual-property-rights-in-the-workplace-a-practical-guide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">RPJ Law</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Practically, for “clean” side projects:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use <strong>personal AI accounts</strong> with no access to employer repos.</li>



<li>Don’t feed in employer-confidential material as context.</li>



<li>Treat AI suggestions like Stack Overflow code: review for license issues, provenance, and similarity to your employer’s IP.</li>



<li></li>
</ul>

<p>“Who owns my side project?” is rarely answered by one magic clause or one statute. It’s a <strong>fact pattern</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What you built,</li>



<li>Where, when, and with whose tools,</li>



<li>How closely it tracks your employer’s business, and</li>



<li>What you signed—and where you work.</li>
</ul>



<p>From a planning standpoint, the best outcomes come from designing side projects and policies to <strong>avoid ambiguity</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Employees build on their own stack, on their own time, away from employer trade secrets.</li>



<li>Employers use clear PIIAA + state-compliant notices, and a lightweight side-project disclosure path instead of “we own your brain” contracts.</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s how you keep side projects as the creative outlet they’re meant to be—rather than the opening paragraph of the next IP lawsuit.</p>
