      <h1>Reddit vs Anthropic &#038; Perplexity: When Ignoring a Cease-and-Desist Becomes Exhibit A</h1>
      <div class="meta">Published: September 10, 2025 • AI, Dispute Resolution, News</div>
      <div class="content">
<p>When Reddit decided to make serious money from its data, it took two paths at once:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>signing <strong>licensing deals</strong> with companies like Google and OpenAI, and</li>



<li>suing AI companies that tried to take the same data for free. </li>
</ul>



<p>Two cases define that strategy right now:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Reddit v. Anthropic</strong> – state court, focused on breach of contract and scraping in violation of Reddit’s terms;</li>



<li><strong>Reddit v. Perplexity + scrapers</strong> – federal court, focused on “industrial-scale” scraping and a <strong>cease-and-desist letter Perplexity allegedly ignored.</strong> (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/reddit-sues-ai-startup-anthropic-allegedly-using-data-without-permission-2025-06-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you run a SaaS platform, an AI product, or a business built on user-generated content, these cases are effectively a live case study in:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>how far you can push your <strong>Terms of Use</strong> as a weapon, and</li>



<li>how much damage you do to yourself by shrugging off a serious demand letter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both cases orbit the same idea:</p>



<p>Reddit views its firehose of user content as <strong>licensable infrastructure</strong>, not a public utility, and it wants courts to ratify that view.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Reddit_v_Anthropic_Terms_of_Use_as_the_Primary_Weapon"></span>Reddit v Anthropic: Terms of Use as the Primary Weapon<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Reddit’s case against Anthropic is deliberately not a classic “you infringed our copyrights” lawsuit.</p>



<p>Instead, the complaint emphasizes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Breach of contract / Terms of Use</strong></li>



<li><strong>Unjust enrichment</strong></li>



<li><strong>Trespass to chattels</strong> (bots hammering servers)</li>



<li><strong>Unfair competition and tortious interference</strong> (<a href="https://www.vitallaw.com/news/technology-internet-news-reddit-lawsuit-targets-anthropic-over-alleged-unauthorized-data-scraping/ipm01ff5b3cd5195547cbb5e7045d5f52787f?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Vital Law</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>The narrative looks roughly like this:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Reddit’s terms and robots.txt draw clear lines on <strong>commercial scraping and reuse</strong> of content.</li>



<li>Anthropic allegedly sent automated bots that hit Reddit’s servers <strong>over 100,000 times</strong>, long after Reddit publicly complained and Anthropic allegedly claimed the bots were blocked. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/reddit-sues-ai-startup-anthropic-allegedly-using-data-without-permission-2025-06-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</li>



<li>Reddit has paying data customers (Google, OpenAI, others). Anthropic, in Reddit’s telling, wanted the same value <strong>without paying</strong>. (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/f5ea042beb253a3f05a091e70531692d?utm_source=chatgpt.com">AP News</a>)</li>
</ol>



<p>So the core injury is framed as:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“You promised not to do this when you clicked through our terms. You did it anyway. And you used it to compete with us and our paying partners.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>That framing matters if you’re a platform or SaaS company, because it says:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You don’t have to win the cosmic “is scraping fair use?” battle to still have a strong case.</li>



<li>You can stay on home turf: <strong>contracts, server abuse, and unfair competition.</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Reddit_v_Perplexity_The_Case_Built_Around_an_Ignored_Demand_Letter"></span>Reddit v Perplexity: The Case Built Around an Ignored Demand Letter<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The Perplexity case adds a new ingredient: a <strong>cease-and-desist letter that allegedly backfired.</strong></p>



<p>According to Reddit:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In <strong>May 2024</strong>, Reddit told Perplexity to <strong>cease and desist</strong> from using Reddit data in its commercial offerings. (<a href="https://redditinc.com/hubfs/Reddit%20Inc/Content/Reddit%20v.%20SerpApi.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reddit Inc</a>)</li>



<li>Instead of backing off, Perplexity allegedly ramped up its use of Reddit data, with citations to Reddit increasing <strong>forty-fold</strong> after the letter. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/reddit-sues-perplexity-scraping-data-train-ai-system-2025-10-22/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>)</li>



<li>Perplexity and its scraping partners (SerpApi, Oxylabs, AWMProxy) are accused of:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>disguising their bots,</li>



<li>masking IPs and locations, and</li>



<li>routing scraping through Google search results to bypass Reddit’s protections. (<a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/23/business/reddit-sues-perplexity-ai-over-industrial-scale-data-scraping/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">New York Post</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Reddit even set a “trap”:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It created a <strong>test post only visible via Google</strong>, not Reddit’s own UI.</li>



<li>That post later appeared in Perplexity’s results, which Reddit cites as proof the data was obtained via scraping schemes rather than normal user access. (<a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/reddit-sues-perplexity-oxylabs-awmproxy-serpapi-data-scraping-train-ai-system/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Adweek</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>From a litigator’s perspective, this is about as clean a story as you can ask for:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>💼 Evidence element</th><th>🧠 What Reddit is trying to show</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Clear ToS + robots.txt</td><td>“We drew bright lines; this isn’t an accident.”</td></tr><tr><td>Cease-and-desist letter</td><td>“We put them on explicit notice and gave them a chance to stop.”</td></tr><tr><td>Post-letter activity spike</td><td>“They knew exactly what they were doing and did more of it anyway.”</td></tr><tr><td>Honey-pot test post</td><td>“We can prove access came through the scraping scheme they deny.”</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>That’s why the ignored C&amp;D is so important. It transforms the case from “maybe they misunderstood the rules” into “they knew we objected and doubled down.”</p>



<p>Perplexity, for its part, publicly insists that it is an “application-layer company,” that it <strong>does not train models on Reddit content</strong>, and that it lawfully accesses data through search engines and available APIs. It portrays Reddit’s position as an attempt to extract payments for lawful access. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perplexity_ai/comments/1odpofv/our_response_to_reddits_lawsuit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reddit</a>)</p>



<p>But whether that narrative is persuasive in court, the <strong>evidentiary posture</strong> created by the C&amp;D plus post-letter spike is exactly what you do <em>not</em> want as a defendant.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_These_Cases_Matter_Beyond_Reddit"></span>Why These Cases Matter Beyond Reddit<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>These suits are not just Reddit drama. They are early attempts to set the rules of the game for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Platforms</strong> built on user content that want to sell access to AI companies, and</li>



<li><strong>AI / SaaS companies</strong> that need training data but don’t want to sign every license that’s waved at them.</li>
</ul>



<p>At a deeper level, they are about who gets to decide:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>whether public web content is effectively “fair game” for training, or</li>



<li>whether platform terms and paywalled APIs become the gatekeepers.</li>
</ul>



<p>If Reddit wins big on a <strong>contract / anti-circumvention / unfair competition</strong> theory, that gives other platforms a playbook:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>tighten your ToS,</li>



<li>invest in anti-scraping tech,</li>



<li>send serious C&amp;Ds,</li>



<li>and sue the companies that ignore them, even without leaning hard on copyright. (<a href="https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/courtside/reddits-lawsuit-over-data-scraping-could-reshape-the-future-of-ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">FindLaw</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>If Reddit loses, or wins only in narrow ways, AI companies will have more comfort treating public web pages as effectively an open training set, at least until legislatures step in.</p>

<p>For lawyers and in-house counsel, the Perplexity case is a reminder that a <strong>well-constructed demand letter</strong> is not just about “asking nicely.”</p>



<p>It’s part of the evidence pipeline.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_the_Reddit_C_D_appears_to_have_done"></span>What the Reddit C&amp;D appears to have done<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Based on the complaint excerpts and commentary:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It made Reddit’s <strong>position crystal clear</strong>: Perplexity’s use of Reddit data for commercial AI products was not authorized. (<a href="https://redditinc.com/hubfs/Reddit%20Inc/Content/Reddit%20v.%20SerpApi.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reddit Inc</a>)</li>



<li>It drew a line in time. Everything that happened afterward can be characterized as <strong>knowing and willful</strong>.</li>



<li>It set the stage for <strong>damages arguments</strong>: “they built a multi-billion-dollar business on data we explicitly told them not to use.” (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-lawsuit-perplexity-ai-firms-data-scrapers-scraping-google-2025-10?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Business Insider</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>In other words, the C&amp;D letter:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>clarified the contract dispute,</li>



<li>framed the equities, and</li>



<li>upgraded any subsequent scraping from “arguably mistaken” to “deliberate.”</li>
</ul>



<p>For a plaintiff, that’s gold.</p>

<p>If you run any business where users post, upload, or generate content, Reddit’s strategy offers a practical blueprint.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Strengthen_your_paper_shield"></span>Strengthen your paper shield<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Your <strong>Terms of Use</strong> and technical policies should be written as if they will one day be read aloud to a judge in a scraping case.</p>



<p>At a minimum, they should:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>define <strong>permitted vs prohibited automated access</strong>,</li>



<li>explicitly restrict <strong>commercial reuse and training of AI models</strong> without a license, and</li>



<li>reserve rights to pursue both <strong>contract and technical-protection claims</strong> (including anti-circumvention theories where appropriate). (<a href="https://www.vitallaw.com/news/technology-internet-news-reddit-lawsuit-targets-anthropic-over-alleged-unauthorized-data-scraping/ipm01ff5b3cd5195547cbb5e7045d5f52787f?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Vital Law</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>Reddit’s complaints spend a lot of time explaining that they are not anti-AI per se—they already license data to some AI firms—but that scraping without paying is a business and trust problem. That narrative is anchored in the text of their ToS.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Treat_serious_demand_letters_as_part_of_your_enforcement_program"></span>Treat serious demand letters as part of your enforcement program<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>If you discover a scraper or AI company abusing your content:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Document</strong> what’s happening (server logs, test posts, reproduced content).</li>



<li>Send a <strong>targeted, specific demand letter</strong> that:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>cites your ToS and any prior public statements;</li>



<li>describes the conduct and how you know it’s happening;</li>



<li>demands cessation and, if appropriate, deletion of derived material;</li>



<li>reserves all rights explicitly.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Track what happens next. If the activity continues or spikes, that timeline is part of your case.</li>
</ol>



<p>From an evidentiary perspective, you want the demand letter to become:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>🎯 Goal</th><th>📜 How the demand letter helps later</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Show notice</td><td>“They cannot say they didn’t know our position.”</td></tr><tr><td>Show willfulness</td><td>“They did more of the same after the letter.”</td></tr><tr><td>Show reasonableness</td><td>“We tried to resolve this without litigation.”</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>That is exactly how Reddit is using its 2024 letter to Perplexity.</p>

<p>If you’re on the other side—building an AI product or a data-dependent SaaS tool—these cases are a loud warning siren.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Know_when_youre_betting_the_company_on_a_ToS_interpretation"></span>Know when you’re betting the company on a ToS interpretation<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>It’s one thing to argue, as Perplexity does, that you’re just an “application layer” tool reading publicly available content via search engines. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perplexity_ai/comments/1odpofv/our_response_to_reddits_lawsuit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reddit</a>)</p>



<p>It’s another thing to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>continue large-scale ingestion after receiving a detailed C&amp;D,</li>



<li>use scrapers or proxy networks that look, in a complaint, very much like <strong>evasion</strong>, and</li>



<li>build a valuation narrative around access to content you haven’t paid for. (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-lawsuit-perplexity-ai-firms-data-scrapers-scraping-google-2025-10?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Business Insider</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>You might be right on the law in the end. But if you’re wrong, you’re not just paying statutory damages—you’re defending the entire business model in a hostile forum with a bad evidentiary record.</p>

<p>For AI and SaaS leadership, a detailed cease-and-desist from a major platform is not “just another letter.” It is:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>a potential <strong>material legal risk</strong>,</li>



<li>an investor-relations problem, and</li>



<li>something regulators will be happy to read.</li>
</ul>



<p>Smart teams:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>escalate these letters to counsel and leadership immediately,</li>



<li>evaluate whether their legal theory is strong enough to justify continued conduct, and</li>



<li>if necessary, <strong>pivot to licensing or alternative data sources</strong> instead of simply hoping the platform will not sue.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ignoring the letter is what turns it into a future plaintiff’s favorite trial exhibit.</p>

<p>Zooming out, Reddit’s dual strategy—license with some AI firms, sue others—is a glimpse of where the ecosystem is going:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Platforms will harden their <strong>technical defenses</strong> and <strong>contract language</strong>.</li>



<li>They’ll use <strong>demand letters</strong> as the first escalation step to draw lines and create notice.</li>



<li>Litigation will focus less on esoteric fair-use arguments and more on <strong>breach of contract, circumvention, unjust enrichment, and abuse of shared infrastructure.</strong> (<a href="https://www.vitallaw.com/news/technology-internet-news-reddit-lawsuit-targets-anthropic-over-alleged-unauthorized-data-scraping/ipm01ff5b3cd5195547cbb5e7045d5f52787f?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Vital Law</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>For lawyers who write demand letters and draft tech contracts, this is fertile ground. Every one of these disputes begins life as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>a ToS someone clicked years ago, and</li>



<li>a letter someone chose either to take seriously or to ignore.</li>
</ul>



<p>Reddit v. Anthropic and Reddit v. Perplexity are simply the first high-profile examples of what happens when you build an AI company on that foundation.</p>
