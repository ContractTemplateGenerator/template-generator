      <div class="content">
<p>Revolve has spent years turning Instagram and TikTok into one long runway. Influencers tag @revolve, post glossy “get ready with me” clips, and the brand quietly prints money.</p>



<p>In April 2025, that model turned into a lawsuit.</p>



<p>A consumer, Ligia Negreanu, filed a proposed $50 million class action in the Central District of California, claiming Revolve and a slate of influencers misled shoppers by hiding that those glowing posts were paid endorsements. (<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/revolve-hit-with-50-million-influencer-advertising-class-action?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Bloomberg Law</a>)</p>



<p>By September, a federal judge sent most of the case into private arbitration, thanks to Revolve’s Terms of Use. (<a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/revolve-nabs-win-as-court-sends-undisclosed-influencer-ad-case-to-arbitration/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">The Fashion Law</a>)</p>



<p>It’s a perfect “influencer wars” case study: consumer deception, FTC rules, contract drafting, and a reminder that your website terms can be as important as your ad copy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_Negreanu_Says_Revolve_Did_Wrong_%F0%9F%A7%A8"></span>What Negreanu Says Revolve Did Wrong 🧨<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Negreanu’s complaint paints Revolve as an influencer-driven machine that broke the basic rule of sponcon: if you’re getting paid, you say so.</p>



<p>She alleges that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Revolve and its subsidiaries (Alliance Apparel Group, Eminent, FWRD) built a business model around paying high-profile influencers – including Cindy Mello, Tika Camaj, and Nienke Jansz – with cash and free product to promote Revolve brands on Instagram and TikTok. (<a href="https://advertisinglaw.fkks.com/post/102k8yc/another-one-revolve-hit-with-50m-class-action-over-undisclosed-influencer-ads?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Passle</a>)</li>



<li>Those posts looked like organic recommendations: tags, glam photos, aspirational captions – but, allegedly, <strong>no clear #ad / #sponsored / “paid partnership” disclosure</strong>. (<a href="https://advertisinglaw.fkks.com/post/102k8yc/another-one-revolve-hit-with-50m-class-action-over-undisclosed-influencer-ads?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Passle</a>)</li>



<li>She bought Revolve items in 2025 after seeing those endorsements, paying prices she says were 10–40% higher than comparable products on other sites because she believed the praise was unbiased. (<a href="https://www.hellowarrant.com/blog/revolve-s-50m-lawsuit-essential-lessons-for-marketers?utm_source=chatgpt.com">hellowarrant.com</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>In her telling, this is not just sloppy hashtagging. It’s a coordinated <strong>“deceptive influencer marketing scheme”</strong> that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>violated state consumer-protection statutes,</li>



<li>artificially inflated prices, and</li>



<li>misled at least a million customers about what they were really paying for. (<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/revolve-hit-with-50-million-influencer-advertising-class-action?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Bloomberg Law</a>)</li>

<p>The complaint leans heavily on the <strong>FTC’s Endorsement Guides</strong>, which require clear, conspicuous disclosure whenever there is a “material connection” between endorser and brand – payment, gifts, affiliate deals, or other benefits. (<a href="https://www.buchalter.com/insights/ad-annoyance-or-necessary-the-rising-risk-of-undisclosed-influencer-deals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Buchalter</a>)</p>



<p>Negreanu argues that Revolve and the influencers turned those rules into a suggestion box.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_This_Is_More_Than_%E2%80%9CForgot_the_ad%E2%80%9D_%F0%9F%93%89"></span>Why This Is More Than “Forgot the #ad” 📉<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>On the surface, this looks like a simple “you didn’t put #ad in your caption” case. The underlying theory is more interesting.</p>



<p>Negreanu claims she and other consumers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>trusted these influencers as tastemakers;</li>



<li>assumed the praise was organic; and</li>



<li>paid a <strong>price premium</strong> for Revolve pieces as a result. (<a href="https://www.hellowarrant.com/blog/revolve-s-50m-lawsuit-essential-lessons-for-marketers?utm_source=chatgpt.com">hellowarrant.com</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>That “premium” theory matters. It turns vague annoyance (“ugh, undisclosed sponcon”) into quantifiable harm: if the posts had been labeled as ads, the argument goes, consumers would have:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>bought less,</li>



<li>bought elsewhere, or</li>



<li>insisted on lower prices.</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s the bridge from “regulatory compliance issue” to “$50M consumer class action.”</p>



<p>It also lines up neatly with Revolve’s own risk disclosures. In its 2023 annual report, Revolve warned that non-compliance with advertising rules, including disclosure obligations, could subject it to regulatory investigations and class actions affecting its business and results. (<a href="https://www.glossy.co/fashion/glossy-101-the-dos-and-donts-of-influencer-partnership-disclosures/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Glossy</a>)</p>



<p>Plantiff’s counsel is basically saying: <em>you told investors this could happen; now it has.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Revolves_Response_Terms_of_Use_as_Shield_%F0%9F%9B%A1%EF%B8%8F"></span>Revolve’s Response: Terms of Use as Shield 🛡️<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Revolve’s first serious move was not to argue “we did disclose” but to say: <strong>you can’t sue us here at all</strong>.</p>



<p>In July 2025, Revolve moved to compel arbitration, pointing to its website Terms of Service. To place an order, Negreanu had to click “Place My Order” next to a conspicuous notice binding her to those terms – including an all-caps arbitration clause and a class-action waiver. (<a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/tl-dr-revolve-aims-for-arbitration-to-fend-off-50m-influencer-lawsuit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">The Fashion Law</a>)</p>



<p>On September 17, 2025, the Central District of California agreed:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Judge Michelle Williams Court held that Negreanu assented to Revolve’s arbitration agreement and did not opt out.</li>



<li>She ordered the claims against Revolve and its corporate affiliates into <strong>private arbitration</strong> and struck the class claims against them. (<a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/revolve-nabs-win-as-court-sends-undisclosed-influencer-ad-case-to-arbitration/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">The Fashion Law</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>Claims against the individual influencers remain in limbo, in part because of service issues, but the headline for brands is clear: <strong>Revolve’s clickwrap and arbitration clause worked.</strong></p>



<p>So the litigation that was supposed to become a public class-action test case for influencer advertising will, at least as to Revolve, likely play out behind closed doors.</p>



<p>From a corporate-law perspective, that’s almost as important as the merits:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The same pattern (undisclosed influencers, price premiums, FTC Guides) can be replicated against other brands. (<a href="https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/06/influencer-marketing-class-actions-on-the-rise-common-themes-and-key-takeaways?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Morgan Lewis</a>)</li>



<li>Whether those brands face a public class action or a quiet arbitration will often turn on how their <strong>online terms</strong> were drafted and presented years earlier.</li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Influencer_Marketing_Law_in_the_Background_%F0%9F%93%B2%E2%9A%96%EF%B8%8F"></span>Influencer Marketing Law in the Background 📲⚖️<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The case sits at the intersection of three overlapping frameworks:</p>



<p><strong>FTC Endorsement Guides and influencer guidance</strong><br>The FTC requires “clear and conspicuous” disclosure when there is a “material connection” between endorser and brand – payment, gifts, affiliate revenue, or other financial or personal ties. “Clear and conspicuous” means hard to miss, in plain language, and close to the endorsement itself (e.g., “#ad”, “Paid partnership with Revolve”). (<a href="https://www.buchalter.com/insights/ad-annoyance-or-necessary-the-rising-risk-of-undisclosed-influencer-deals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Buchalter</a>)</p>



<p><strong>State consumer-protection statutes</strong><br>Negreanu pleads violations of California consumer laws (and similar statutes for the putative nationwide class) on a theory that Revolve’s non-disclosure was deceptive and caused economic harm. The FTC Guides are not directly enforceable by private plaintiffs, but they are often used as a <strong>benchmark</strong> for what counts as misleading. (<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/revolve-faces-50m-class-action-alleging-7715444/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">JD Supra</a>)</p>



<p><strong>Contract and arbitration law</strong><br>The fight over where the case is heard – court vs. arbitration – is all contract. The judge’s order shows that Revolve’s <strong>clickwrap design and record-keeping</strong> were solid enough that the arbitration clause was enforced with little difficulty. (<a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/revolve-nabs-win-as-court-sends-undisclosed-influencer-ad-case-to-arbitration/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">The Fashion Law</a>)</p>



<p>In other words, this isn’t just a story about influencers forgetting #ad; it’s also about:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>how you structure your customer contract;</li>



<li>how you document assent; and</li>



<li>whether you’re comfortable defending those terms under scrutiny.</li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_This_Case_Matters_Beyond_Revolve_%F0%9F%8C%90"></span>Why This Case Matters Beyond Revolve 🌐<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Negreanu v. Revolve is often described in commentary as a “turning point” case for influencer marketing risk. (<a href="https://www.coblentzlaw.com/news/beyond-the-ftc-consumer-class-actions-are-redefining-influencer-marketing-risk/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Coblentz Law</a>)</p>



<p>A few reasons:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It targets <strong>both the brand and individual influencers</strong>, making clear that creators can be named defendants, not just “talent” on the sidelines. (<a href="https://advertisinglaw.fkks.com/post/102k8yc/another-one-revolve-hit-with-50m-class-action-over-undisclosed-influencer-ads?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Passle</a>)</li>



<li>It uses <strong>FTC-style theories</strong> (material-connection disclosure) as the backbone of a private class action, not just an FTC or NAD enforcement matter. (<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/revolve-faces-50m-class-action-alleging-7715444/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">JD Supra</a>)</li>



<li>It shows how quickly these cases can move into arbitration if a brand has robust online terms, essentially privatizing what could have been a big public precedent. (<a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/revolve-nabs-win-as-court-sends-undisclosed-influencer-ad-case-to-arbitration/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">The Fashion Law</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>It also lands in the middle of a broader wave: by mid-2025, multiple brands and influencers across industries were hit with similar class actions for undisclosed or poorly disclosed influencer deals. (<a href="https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/06/influencer-marketing-class-actions-on-the-rise-common-themes-and-key-takeaways?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Morgan Lewis</a>)</p>



<p>Revolve just happens to be the most photogenic example.</p>

<p>You can’t run an influencer-heavy business in 2025 and treat legal as an afterthought. The Revolve suit is a reminder that three documents need to talk to each other:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>📄 Document Layer</th><th>🎯 What Needs to Be True After Revolve</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Influencer contracts</td><td>Explicit, enforceable obligations to follow FTC (and foreign) disclosure rules; brand approval rights over captions and tags; audit and takedown rights if the influencer goes off-script. (<a href="https://www.buchalter.com/insights/ad-annoyance-or-necessary-the-rising-risk-of-undisclosed-influencer-deals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Buchalter</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>Social and marketing playbooks</td><td>Concrete examples of compliant captions and stories; “no post goes live without visible disclosure if you got anything of value” baked into process, not just policy. (<a href="https://www.buchalter.com/insights/ad-annoyance-or-necessary-the-rising-risk-of-undisclosed-influencer-deals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Buchalter</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>Consumer-facing terms</td><td>Properly implemented clickwrap; clear arbitration/class-waiver strategy if you want disputes in private; strong but fair limitation-of-liability and choice-of-law clauses. (<a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/tl-dr-revolve-aims-for-arbitration-to-fend-off-50m-influencer-lawsuit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">The Fashion Law</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>For influencers, the case is a warning that “the brand will handle compliance” is no longer a safe assumption. Plaintiffs are naming individual creators and treating them as joint participants in deceptive schemes, not passive mouthpieces. (<a href="https://advertisinglaw.fkks.com/post/102k8yc/another-one-revolve-hit-with-50m-class-action-over-undisclosed-influencer-ads?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Passle</a>)</p>



<p>For lawyers, it’s a textbook “influencer wars” fact pattern to build into your templates:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The pricing-premium theory,</li>



<li>the way the complaint leans on FTC Guides without needing FTC enforcement,</li>



<li>and the way a well-drafted arbitration clause can flip a public PR liability into a contained private process.</li>
</ul>



<p>Revolve’s lawsuit won’t be the last. It’s just the one that turned a lot of quiet compliance slides into a very loud wake-up call.</p>
