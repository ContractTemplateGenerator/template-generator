<div class="section-subtitle">Strategy 1: Acknowledge &#038; Resolve (Legitimate Claims)</div>
<p>If tenant&#8217;s claim is valid:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Acknowledge the issue promptly</li>
<li>Make repairs or provide CAM refund as appropriate</li>
<li>Document resolution and obtain tenant&#8217;s sign-off</li>

<p>If some claims are valid, others are not:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Address valid issues (repairs, legitimate CAM corrections)</li>
<li>Refute invalid claims with lease citations and evidence</li>
<li>Offer compromise on disputed items to avoid litigation</li>

<div class="section-subtitle">Strategy 3: Full Defense (Meritless Claims)</div>
<p>If tenant&#8217;s claims are unfounded:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Provide detailed response citing lease provisions</li>

<li>State tenant&#8217;s claims are without merit and you will vigorously defend if tenant litigates</li>
<li>Do not offer concessions for meritless claims</li>

<div class="section-subtitle">CAM Dispute Response Strategy</div>
<p>When tenant disputes CAM reconciliation:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Review Audit Request:</strong> Comply with lease audit rights; provide requested documentation promptly</li>
<li><strong>Identify Errors:</strong> If audit reveals legitimate errors, issue corrected reconciliation and refund</li>
<li><strong>Defend Proper Charges:</strong> For disputed charges that are proper, provide detailed explanation citing lease definitions of &#8220;Operating Expenses&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Negotiate Settlement:</strong> If tenant has some valid points, offer partial credit to avoid litigation</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Repair Dispute Response Strategy</div>
<p>When tenant claims failure to repair:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Check Lease Allocation:</strong> Verify repair is your responsibility (not tenant&#8217;s under NNN lease)</li>
<li><strong>Review Notice:</strong> Did tenant give proper written notice? When? Did you respond?</li>

RE: Response to Your CAM Dispute Letter Dated [Date]
     [Property Address]

Dear [Tenant]:

I am responding to your letter dated [Date] disputing the CAM reconciliation for [Year].

I have reviewed your audit report and our records. Here is my response to each issue you raised:

1. PARKING LOT RESURFACING ($[Amount]):

You claim this is a capital expense that should be amortized. I agree. This was an error in our reconciliation. The parking lot resurfacing has a 15-year useful life. The correct annual charge is $[Amount/15].

Adjustment: Credit $[Amount]

2. ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE:

You claim we improperly excluded vacant spaces. After reviewing, you are correct that per Lease § [X], allocation should include all leasable square footage. We have recalculated your share as [X]% instead of [X]%.

Adjustment: Credit $[Amount]

3. MANAGEMENT FEE (15%):

You claim the 15% management fee is excessive. I disagree. Our management company provides comprehensive services including [list services]. Section [X] of the Lease states management fees shall be &#8220;customary and reasonable.&#8221; In [City], commercial property management fees range from 10-18% depending on services. Our 15% fee is within market range and reasonable given the extensive services provided.

No adjustment.

4. LEASING COMMISSIONS:

You are correct that leasing commissions are explicitly excluded by Lease § [X]. This was an administrative error.

Adjustment: Credit $[Amount]

CORRECTED RECONCILIATION:

Original Reconciliation Total:        $[Amount]
Less: Adjustments 1, 2, and 4:       ($[Amount])

Revised Total CAM:                    $[Amount]
Your Corrected Share:                 $[Amount]
Amount You Paid:                      $[Amount]

CREDIT DUE: $[Amount]

RESOLUTION:

I will apply the $[Amount] credit to your next three months&#8217; CAM payments ($[Amount] per month).

I have attached the corrected reconciliation statement with updated allocation schedule and amortization calculation.

Thank you for bringing these issues to our attention. If you have questions about the revised statement, please contact me.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
[Your Name]

RE: Response to Demand for Repairs – [Property Address]

Dear [Tenant]:

I am responding to your letter dated [Date] claiming I failed to repair the HVAC system.

LEASE RESPONSIBILITIES:

Section [X] of the Lease (&#8220;Maintenance and Repairs&#8221;) states:

   &#8220;Tenant shall be responsible for all repairs and maintenance to the Premises, including HVAC systems, plumbing, electrical, and all interior and exterior components.&#8221;

This is a triple net (NNN) lease. You are responsible for all repairs, including HVAC maintenance and replacement.

NOTICE AND RESPONSE:

You state you notified me on [Date] about the HVAC issue. I have reviewed my records and find:
• I received your email on [Date] stating the AC was &#8220;not cooling well&#8221;
• I responded on [Date] advising you to contact your HVAC contractor, as HVAC maintenance is your responsibility per the Lease
• I provided contact information for three licensed HVAC contractors

I fulfilled my obligations by responding promptly and clarifying lease responsibilities.

CONCLUSION:

Your demand that I repair the HVAC and reimburse you for lost revenue has no merit. Under the Lease, HVAC repairs are your responsibility.

If you believe the Lease requires me to repair HVAC systems, please cite the specific lease provision. I am not aware of any such provision.

I reserve all rights under the Lease.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
[Your Name]</div>

RE: Response to Your Letter Regarding Construction Interference

Dear [Tenant]:

Thank you for your letter dated [Date] regarding construction disruptions from our renovation of Suite [X].

I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused your business. I take your concerns seriously.

ACTIONS TAKEN:

I have instructed my contractor to:
• Move all equipment and trucks away from your storefront immediately
• Limit noisy work (jackhammering, sawing) to weekdays between 8:00 AM &#8211; 5:00 PM (after your business hours)
• Ensure main parking lot entrance remains clear at all times
• Provide you 24-hour advance notice of any planned utility shutoffs

TIMELINE:

The renovation is scheduled to be completed by [Date – 2 weeks from now]. I will personally monitor the site to ensure compliance with these restrictions.

RENT ADJUSTMENT:

I recognize the disruption has affected your business. I am willing to provide a 10% rent abatement for the period of [Date] through [Completion Date] (approximately [X] weeks) as compensation for the inconvenience.

If this is acceptable, please sign the attached rent adjustment agreement and return it to me.

Again, I apologize for the disruption and appreciate your patience as we complete this necessary renovation.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
[Your Name]
