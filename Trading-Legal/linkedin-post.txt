I built a free legal resource hub for trading platform founders.

After years of fielding the same questions from fintech founders—"Do I need to register as an RIA?" "What's a CTA?" "Will the SEC come after my algo trading app?"—I decided to create something that didn't exist: a comprehensive legal resource hub built specifically for people building algorithmic trading platforms, robo-advisers, and AI-powered investment tools.

Here's what's inside:

100+ Legal Guides covering:
- SEC investment adviser registration
- CFTC CTA/CPO requirements
- FinCEN AML compliance
- State money transmitter licensing
- Crypto & DeFi regulatory frameworks
- International expansion (EU MiFID II, UK FCA, Singapore MAS)

Interactive Tools:
- Investment Adviser Decision Tree (Do I actually need to register?)
- 475(f) Tax Calculator (Mark-to-market election analysis)
- State Registration Finder (MTL requirements by state)

Founder Compliance Workbench:
A persistent dashboard that tracks your regulatory exposure, flags active compliance issues, and generates personalized next steps based on your business model.

Why I built this:
Trading platform founders face a unique regulatory maze. You might need to talk to the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, and multiple state regulators—sometimes all at once. Most legal content online is either too generic or written for institutional players with seven-figure compliance budgets.

This hub is different. It's written in plain language, focused on practical steps, and designed to help you get regulatory clarity in 15 minutes instead of 15 meetings.

It's completely free. No signup required.

If you're building anything involving algorithmic trading, copy trading, signal services, trading bots, or crypto investment tools—this is for you.
