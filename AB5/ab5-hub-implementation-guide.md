### Phase 1: Win the Gina Contract (This Week)

**Upload Sequence:**
1. Upload cleaning services page to `/employment/ab5-cleaning-services/`
2. Upload classifier tool to `/employment/tools/ab5-model-classifier.html`
3. Upload pillar page to `/employment/ca-worker-classification/`

**Upwork Proposal to Gina:**

Subject: "California cleaning business compliance - I've already built the framework"

```
Gina,

I've already created the comprehensive resource you need. Before you read 
further, check out my cleaning business worker classification page:

https://terms.law/employment/ab5-cleaning-services/

It explains exactly why most cleaning companies fail AB 5's Prong B and 
what your compliance options are.

Then run your model through my interactive classifier:
https://terms.law/employment/tools/ab5-model-classifier.html

You'll get a preliminary risk assessment in 3 minutes.

WHY I'M THE RIGHT ATTORNEY:

I've analyzed AB 5 compliance across hundreds of service businesses. Unlike 
general employment attorneys who give you a 20-page legal treatise, I focus 
on what founders actually need: a clear path forward you can implement.

YOUR DELIVERABLES ($450 fixed fee):

1. Business Model Analysis
   - Written intake questionnaire
   - AB 5 / ABC test analysis specific to your cleaning business
   - Risk flags and why they matter

2. Classification Recommendation (1-2 pages)
   - Plain-English conclusion: IC vs employee path
   - Operational compliance steps
   - Not legal theory - practical implementation

3. One California-Compliant Agreement
   - Independent Contractor Agreement OR Employment Agreement
   - Aligned with the recommendation, not generic templates
   - One revision round included

4. Implementation Q&A (~30 min)
   - Call or written follow-up
   - Clarify recommendation and next steps
   - Enough to implement without endless scope creep

TIMELINE:
- Complete analysis within 3 business days
- Agreement draft within 2 days after you approve structure
- Total turnaround: 5-7 days

The pages I linked show you exactly how I think about these issues. 
You're not buying a generic IC agreement - you're getting a defensible 
classification path.

### Phase 2: Build Industry Cluster Pages (Next 2 Weeks)

**Priority Order:**
1. **Prong B Deep Dive** (`/employment/ab5-prong-b-usual-course/`)
   - This is THE universal failure point
   - Most linked page in your hub
   - Creates "attorney moat" - competitors can't replicate this depth

2. **Gig/Rideshare** (`/employment/ab5-gig-rideshare-delivery/`)
   - Huge market
   - Tons of search volume
   - Dynamex case originated here

3. **Marketplaces** (`/employment/ab5-marketplaces-platforms/`)
   - Two-sided platform analysis
   - Managed workforce vs true marketplace
   - Control signals decision tree

4. **Tech Contractors** (`/employment/ab5-tech-startups-contractors/`)
   - YOUR actual client base

5. **Home & Field Services** (umbrella page)
   - Links to cleaning subpage
   - Covers landscaping, HVAC, mobile services
   - Travel time compliance issues

6-8. Build remaining clusters as traffic/client demand dictates

### Phase 3: Tool Expansion (Ongoing)

**Additional Tools to Build:**

1. **Exemption Checker** (`/employment/tools/ab5-exemption-checker.html`)

   - Evidence checklist for each test
   - Links to relevant cluster pages

2. **Wage & Hour Calculator** (`/employment/tools/wage-hour-calculator.html`)
   - IC vs employee cost comparison
   - Inputs: workers, hours, rate, location
   - Outputs: payroll taxes, workers comp, total cost difference

3. **Field Workforce Planner** (`/employment/tools/field-workforce-planner.html`)
   - Travel time calculator
   - Mileage reimbursement estimator
   - Break compliance for mobile workers

4. **PAGA Exposure Calculator**
   - Potential PAGA penalties based on violations
   - Helps founders understand real risk
   - Fear-based but legitimate

**The Vision:**
You become THE California worker classification authority. When a founder 
Googles "AB 5 [anything]" they find your hub. When they need legal help, 
you've already demonstrated expertise through valuable free tools. When they 
hire you, they're buying implementation of a framework they already understand.

This isn't "lawyer creates website." This is "lawyer creates unreplicable 
competitive advantage through sophisticated legal analysis + technical execution."
