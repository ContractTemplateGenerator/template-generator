<p><span style="background-color:white;font-family:Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;line-height:19px;">SAN DIEGO.</span><span style="background-color:white;font-family:Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;line-height:19px;"> </span>On January 1, 2012, it becomes <u>illegal in California for most employers to request a credit report on a prospective employee</u> without the employee’s consent. Prior to that, a California employer could request a prospective employee’s credit report, as long as the employee had been previously notified of that action and given an opportunity to obtain a copy.</p>
<p>The Assembly Bill No. 22, amends Section 1785.20.5 of the <i>California Civil Code</i> and limits the employer’s right to request a credit report to the following situations when a prospective employee:</p>
<p>(1) is seeking a position in the state Department of Justice, <br />(2) a managerial position,<br />(3) that of a sworn peace officer or other law enforcement position, <br />(4) a position for which the information contained in the report is required by law to be disclosed or obtained, <br />(5) a position that involves regular access to specified personal information for any purpose other than the routine solicitation and processing of credit card applications in a retail establishment, <br />(6) a position in which the person is or would be a named signatory on the employer’s bank or credit card account, or authorized to transfer money or enter into financial contracts on the employer’s behalf, <br />(7) a position that involves access to confidential or proprietary information, or <br />(8) a position that involves regular access to $10,000 or more of cash.</p>
<p>If the above does not describe your situation, the employer may only request your credit report with your permission.</p>
