                    <p>Frederick Ker was forcibly abducted from Peru and brought to Illinois for trial.

The Court reaffirmed the Ker doctrine, holding that the power of a court to try a person is not impaired by the manner in which he is brought within the court's jurisdiction.

Mexico protested, but the Supreme Court held (6-3) that the U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty's silence on abduction meant it did not prohibit abduction, and thus jurisdiction was proper. This is the key precedent for the Maduro case.</p>

                                <p>The 2020 indictment preceded the capture by six years, demonstrating this was not post-hoc justification. The legal process followed normal channels, with formal charges issued based on evidence gathered through legitimate means.</p>

                        <p>The Ker-Frisbie doctrine is a principle of U.S. criminal procedure holding that courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant regardless of how the defendant was brought before the court.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Elements:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Originated in Ker v. Illinois (1886) - defendant abducted from Peru</li>
                            <li>Reaffirmed in Frisbie v. Collins (1952) - kidnapping from one state to another</li>
                            <li>Courts focus on whether they have jurisdiction, not how defendant arrived</li>
                            <li>Even forcible abduction does not divest the court of jurisdiction</li>
                            <li>The defendant may still face trial and conviction</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Policy Rationale:</strong> The doctrine reflects a practical judgment that courts should not serve as refuges for those who commit crimes simply because of irregularities in their apprehension. The focus is on guilt or innocence, not the means of capture.</p>

                        <p>United States v. Alvarez-Machain (1992) is the most directly applicable Supreme Court precedent for the Maduro capture.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Case:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dr. Humberto Alvarez-Machain was a Mexican citizen</li>
                            <li>Accused of participating in the torture-murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camarena</li>
                            <li>Abducted from Mexico by DEA-hired operatives in 1990</li>
                            <li>Mexico formally protested and demanded return</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>The Holding (6-3 Decision):</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty did not prohibit abduction</li>
                            <li>A treaty's silence on abduction means abduction does not violate the treaty</li>
                            <li>The Ker-Frisbie doctrine applies to international abductions</li>
                            <li>Jurisdiction was proper despite Mexico's objections</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Relevance to Maduro:</strong> This precedent strongly suggests U.S. courts will exercise jurisdiction over Maduro regardless of how he was captured, unless a specific treaty provision prohibits such capture.</p>

                        <p>United States v. Toscanino (2d Cir. 1974) created a narrow exception to the Ker-Frisbie doctrine for cases involving extreme government misconduct.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Facts:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Toscanino alleged he was kidnapped in Uruguay</li>
                            <li>Claimed he was tortured for 17 days with electric shocks, starvation, and beatings</li>
                            <li>Argued this treatment "shocked the conscience" and required dismissal</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>The Exception:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Courts may dismiss if government conduct is "so outrageous" it shocks the conscience</li>
                            <li>Must involve torture, brutality, or conduct violating fundamental rights</li>
                            <li>Mere illegal arrest or abduction is NOT sufficient</li>
                            <li>Exception is extremely narrow and rarely applied successfully</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Will It Apply to Maduro?:</strong> Almost certainly not. The exception requires torture or extreme abuse during capture. A clean capture operation, even if involving force, would not trigger the Toscanino exception.</p>

                        <p>If the capture violated international law, what remedies are available? The answer may surprise those expecting dismissal.</p>
                        <p><strong>Remedies NOT Available:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dismissal:</strong> U.S. courts will not dismiss based on capture method (Ker-Frisbie)</li>
                            <li><strong>Exclusion of Evidence:</strong> No automatic exclusionary rule for manner of capture</li>
                            <li><strong>Return to Foreign Country:</strong> Courts lack authority to order this</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Remedies That ARE Available:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Diplomatic Protest:</strong> Venezuela can formally protest to the U.S.</li>
                            <li><strong>UN Complaint:</strong> Venezuela can raise the issue at the UN Security Council</li>
                            <li><strong>ICJ Proceeding:</strong> Venezuela could potentially file a case at the International Court of Justice</li>
                            <li><strong>Civil Suit (Unlikely):</strong> Theoretical civil claims under FTCA or Bivens, but sovereign immunity and standing issues make success improbable</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>The Reality:</strong> International law violations in capture typically result in diplomatic friction, not judicial remedies. The prosecution will proceed.</p>
