<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Introduction"></span>Introduction<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>In the business world, growth is essential for survival. There are a few ways to achieve growth, but one of the most common and effective is through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A). M&amp;A can be defined as “a general term used to describe the consolidation of companies or assets through various types of financial transactions.”</p>



<p>M&amp;A can be an effective way to grow a company quickly. When done correctly, it can add new products or services, new technologies, new talent, and new customers. It can also help a company enter new markets or expand its footprint in existing markets. And while there are risks associated with M&amp;A, such as overpaying or integrating two cultures that clash, the potential rewards make it a strategy that is often worth pursuing.</p>



<p>For CEO’s, M&amp;A can be an attractive option because it allows them to make transformative changes to their companies without having to go through the time-consuming and often difficult process of organically growing their businesses. Additionally, M&amp;A can help CEO’s boost their stock prices and increase shareholder value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Common_Reasons_for_Pursuing_M_A"></span>Common Reasons for Pursuing M&amp;A<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>There are many reasons why companies pursue M&amp;A transactions. Some common reasons include:</p>



<p>1. To enter new markets</p>



<p>2. To expand into adjacent markets</p>



<p>3 .To acquire complementary products or services</p>



<p>4 .To acquire technology or other intellectual property</p>



<p>5 .To gain access to new talent</p>



<p>6 .To boost growth</p>



<p>7 .To enhance shareholder value</p>



<p>8 .To increase market share</p>



<p>9. To achieve economies of scale</p>



<p>10.To reduce competition</p>



<p>11.To diversify revenue sources</p>



<p>12.To hedge against macroeconomic trends</p>



<p>In addition to the reasons above, there are often more personal motivations for why CEO’s pursue M&amp;A. For example, some CEO’s may feel pressure to grow their companies quickly in order to meet the expectations of shareholders or board members. Others may view M&amp;A as a way to make a “transformational” change to their company that will help it better compete in the future. Additionally, some CEO’s may simply feel that M&amp;A is the best way to grow their company given the current market conditions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Types_of_M_A_Transactions"></span>Types of M&amp;A Transactions<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The following are some common transaction types that fall under the M&amp;A umbrella.</p>



<p>1. Mergers: A merger occurs when two companies combine to form a new company. The shareholders of each company receive shares in the new company in exchange for their shares in the old company.</p>



<p>2. Acquisitions: An acquisition occurs when one company buys another company. The shareholders of the acquired company receive cash or shares in the acquiring company in exchange for their shares in the old company.</p>



<p>3. Consolidations: A consolidation occurs when two or more companies combine to form a new company, but unlike a merger, the shareholders of the old companies do not receive any equity in the new company. Instead, they receive cash or debt instruments.</p>



<p>4. Divestitures: A divestiture occurs when a company sells all or part of its business through an asset sale, share sale, spin-off, or some other type of transaction.</p>



<p>5. Tender Offers. In a tender offer, one business offers to buy the other company&#8217;s outstanding shares for a fixed price rather than the market price. The purchasing business makes the offer directly to the shareholders of the other company, bypassing management and the board of directors.</p>



<p>6. Asset Acquisition. In an asset acquisition, one business directly acquires the assets of another. The corporation whose assets are being acquired must gain shareholder approval. During a bankruptcy case, other businesses bid on different assets of the bankrupt company, which is liquidated following the ultimate transfer of assets to the purchasing corporations.</p>



<p>7. Management Acquisitions. A management acquisition, also known as a management-led buyout (MBO), occurs when a business&#8217;s leaders acquire a majority share in another company and take it private. In order to assist finance a deal, these former executives often collaborate with a financier or former corporate officials. Such mergers and acquisitions are often funded disproportionately with debt, and they must be approved by a majority of shareholders. For example, Dell Corporation announced in 2013 that it had been acquired by its founder, Michael Dell.</p>



<p>The type of transaction that makes sense for a given situation depends on a variety of factors such as the strategic objectives of the companies involved, regulatory considerations, tax implications, and shareholder preferences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_Mergers_Are_Structured"></span>How Mergers Are Structured<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Mergers may be arranged in a variety of ways, depending on the connection between the two firms participating in the transaction:</p>



<p><strong>Horizontal merger</strong>: A merger between two firms that compete in the same product lines and marketplaces.</p>



<p>A <strong>vertical merger</strong> involves a client and a firm, or a supplier and a company. Consider an ice cream manufacturer acquiring a cone provider.</p>



<p><strong>Congeneric mergers</strong> include two companies that service the same customer base in different methods, such as a TV maker and a cable provider.</p>



<p>A <strong>market-extension merger</strong> occurs when two firms offer the same items in separate markets.</p>



<p>A <strong>product-extension merger</strong> occurs when two firms offer distinct but related items in the same market.</p>



<p><strong>Conglomeration</strong>: Two firms with no common business sectors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_Acquisitions_Are_Financed"></span>How Acquisitions Are Financed<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>A corporation may purchase another firm using cash, stock, debt assumption, or a mix of the three. In smaller transactions, it is also usual for one firm to purchase all of the assets of another company. Company X purchases all of Company Y&#8217;s assets for cash, leaving Company Y with just cash (and debt, if any). Of course, Company Y becomes a shell and will ultimately liquidate or explore other markets.</p>



<p>A reverse merger is another kind of acquisition arrangement that allows a private firm to become publicly traded in a very short amount of time. Reverse mergers occur when a private corporation with promising prospects and a strong need for finance acquires a publicly traded shell company with no actual business activities and little assets. The private firm reverses its merger with the public company, and the two companies combine to form an entirely new public corporation with marketable shares.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_Are_Mergers_and_Acquisitions_Valued"></span>How Are Mergers and Acquisitions Valued<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Both firms on either side of an M&amp;A transaction will place a different value on the target company. The seller will undoubtedly value the firm at the greatest possible price, while the buyer will want to purchase it at the lowest feasible price. Fortunately, a firm may be objectively valued by researching similar companies in a sector and depending on the measures listed below.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="PE_Ratio_Price-to-Earnings_Ratio"></span>P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>An acquiring business uses a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) to make an offer that is a multiple of the target company&#8217;s earnings. Examining the P/E multiples for all companies in the same industry group will provide the acquiring business with a solid indication of what the target&#8217;s P/E multiple should be.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Enterprise-Value-to-Sales_EVSales_Ratio"></span>Enterprise-Value-to-Sales (EV/Sales) Ratio<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>The purchasing corporation uses an enterprise-value-to-sales ratio (EV/sales) to make an offer as a multiple of revenues while keeping in mind the price-to-sales (P/S ratio) of competing companies in the industry.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Discounted_Cash_Flow_DCF"></span>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>A discounted cash flow (DFC) analysis, a major valuation method in M&amp;A, calculates a company&#8217;s present value based on its expected future cash flows. Forecasted free cash flows are discounted to present value using the company&#8217;s weighted average cost of capital (net income + depreciation/amortization (capital expenditures) change in working capital) (WACC). To be sure, DCF is difficult to master, but few tools can compete with it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Replacement_Cost"></span>Replacement Cost<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Acquisitions are often predicated on the cost of replacing the target firm. Assume that the value of a corporation is just the sum of its equipment and personnel expenses. The purchasing business may essentially command the target to sell at that price, or it will develop a competition at the same cost.</p>



<p>Naturally, assembling strong management, acquiring land, and purchasing the necessary equipment takes time. This approach of determining a price makes little sense in a service business when the essential assets (people and ideas) are difficult to value and grow.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_Do_Mergers_Differ_From_Acquisitions"></span>How Do Mergers Differ From Acquisitions?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>In a merger, two companies come together to form a new company. The shareholders of each company receive shares in the new company in exchange for their shares in the old company. In an acquisition, one company buys another company. The shareholders of the acquired company receive cash or shares in the acquiring company in exchange for their shares in the old company.</p>

<p>Horizontal and vertical integration are competitive techniques used by businesses to strengthen their position among rivals. The acquisition of a similar firm is an example of horizontal integration. A firm that chooses horizontal integration will purchase another company that works at the same level of an industry&#8217;s value chain, such as when Marriott International, Inc. acquired Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide, Inc.</p>



<p>Vertical integration is the acquisition of company activities within the same industrial vertical. Vertical integration means that a corporation has total control over one or more stages of a product&#8217;s manufacturing or distribution. Apple, for example, purchased AuthenTec, which manufactures the touch ID fingerprint sensor technology used in iPhones.</p>

<p>A reverse merger is the process by which a private company acquires a public company so that the private company can become public without going through an initial public offering (IPO). In a reverse merger, the shares of the private company are exchanged for the shares of the public company, and the resulting entity is typically renamed. The management team of the private company usually remains in place following the transaction.</p>
