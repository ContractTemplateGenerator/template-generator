Finance</a></em></p>



<p>In this article, we discuss 10 best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy according to hedge funds. If you want to read about some more S&amp;P 500 stocks, go directly to&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://terms.law/2022/10/18/5-best-sp-500-stocks-to-buy-according-to-hedge-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.</a></strong></p>



<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States recently released new inflation numbers that have brought into question the aggressive rate hike policy of the Federal Reserve. Per the latest figures, the consumer price index showed that prices in the country during the month of September were 8.2% higher compared to prices over the same period last year. The rate represents yet another decline for the benchmark inflation index in the months following June. The inflation rate had peaked at over 9% in June, the highest in nearly four decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to aggressive rate hikes by the central bank to tame inflation, investors have been pulling money from the stock market to invest in less riskier ventures, pushing the US towards a recession. Benchmark market indexes like the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are all trading in the red since the past few months. They have registered year-to-date declines of 22%, 31%, and 16%, respectively. The chaos is spreading to global markets in the meanwhile as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this slowdown has created several buying opportunities at the market where prominent names like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/johnson%20%26%20johnson/200406/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">JNJ</a>), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/pfizer%20inc/78003/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PFE</a>), and The Proctor and Gamble Company (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/procter%20%26%20gamble%20co/80424/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PG</a>) are all trading at discounted prices due to the overall macro uncertainty. Investors can pick up the shares of these businesses at bargain rates and since the bear market is expected to wind down in the coming months, these stocks could be the first to rally as the economy recovers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Our Methodology</em></strong></p>



<p>The companies that feature on the S&amp;P 500 were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Salesforce, Inc.&nbsp;(NYSE:CRM)&nbsp;has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.”</p>

Apple’s shares detracted from performance as management lowered its guidance for the second quarter due to headwinds from the war in Ukraine, adverse foreign currency shifts, and dampened consumer demand associated with the coronavirus in China. Additionally, many investors were concerned that lockdowns implemented to curtail the spread of COVID-19 would impact production of apple products, however the manufacturing facilities have resumed activity.”</p>
