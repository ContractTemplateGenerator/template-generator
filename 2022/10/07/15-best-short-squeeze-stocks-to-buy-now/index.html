<p>Gamstop Corporation 9. (NYSE:GME)<br>Holders of Hedge Funds: 17</p>



<p>As of September 14, there was 18.51% short interest.</p>



<p>The Texas-based retailer of games and entertainment goods is called GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME). On September 7, the business announced a non-GAAP loss per share for the second quarter of $0.35, surpassing market expectations by $0.06. The $1.14 billion in sales decreased 3.4% from the prior year, below Wall Street projections by $130 million. The 2021 short squeeze of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) garnered media attention, and retail investors are still supporting the company despite the fact that valuation does not correspond to underlying fundamentals. It is among the top short squeeze stocks to purchase right now.</p>



<p>On July 22, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter restated an Underperform rating on GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) while lowering the price target from $30 to $7.50. The stock of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is still trading at levels that don&#8217;t seem to be in line with the company&#8217;s fundamentals, and the company&#8217;s turnaround strategy hasn&#8217;t worked out so far, the analyst informed investors in a research note.</p>



<p>At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 17 of the hedge funds monitored by Insider Monkey were long GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME), down from 18 funds the previous quarter. A prominent shareholder in the firm is Mason Capital Management, which has 518,445 shares worth about $19 million.</p>



<p>In their investor letter for Q2 2022, Bireme Capital expressly mentioned GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) as follows:</p>



<p>Unbelievably, GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is the only one of our short holdings that will be stable in 2022. The stock now has a market valuation of $11.5 billion, which is much more than its pre-pandemic high. This is despite the fact that sales is 30% lower than it was at its height, gross margins have shrunk by 1500 bps, and the business has lost $700 million in free cash over the last four quarters (we had to double check that number because it is so high).</p>



<p>Wall Street&#8217;s forecasts of Gamestop&#8217;s profitability have been constantly lowered down, which makes the company&#8217;s stock price stability in 2022 all the more puzzling. Analysts&#8217; current estimate of an EBITDA loss is roughly $400m, which is much greater than their forecast of a loss of $60m as of February 3, 22. Their newly introduced NFT marketplace, which came out approximately a year too late to be effective in the NFT industry, will do little to improve their core business. Instead, we view this as another instance of a meme stock firm trying to copy its way into a different business model by relying on the stock&#8217;s popularity to fuel new business lines. The $11.5 billion market valuation, in our opinion, vastly overestimates Gamestop&#8217;s capacity to change course and become more profitable. We don&#8217;t think Gamestop will ever post a GAAP profit again.</p>



<p>The company AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC)<br>Holders of Hedge Funds: 18</p>



<p>As of September 14, there was 19.39% short interest.</p>



<p>Theaters in the US and Europe are owned and run by AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC). Hedge funds heavily shorted AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop in 2021. Redditors are still eager to start a short squeeze and remain optimistic about AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC).</p>



<p>On August 23, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter maintained an Underperform rating on AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMCstock )&#8217;s while lowering the price objective from $4 to $2. The expert highlighted that while theatrical exhibition is beginning to normalize, there have been significant production delays over the last year and the amount of material has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels. The analyst reduced his price estimate to $2 after updating his model to account for the additional shares since AMC Preferred Equity started trading on August 22.</p>



<p>At the end of Q2 2022, 18 hedge funds were positive on AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), up from 16 firms the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey data. With 2.8 million shares worth $38.2 million, Israel Englander&#8217;s Millennium Management is the business with the greatest stake.</p>



<p>The company Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:APRN)<br>11 holders of hedge funds.</p>

<p>Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:APRN) was the subject of new research by Lake Street analyst Ryan Meyers on August 10 with a Buy rating and a $9 price target. He thinks the adjustments Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:APRN) has made since hiring CEO Linda Findley in 2019 have strengthened its position in the market and enabled sustainable growth.</p>



<p>11 hedge funds were positive on Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:APRN), according to Insider Monkey&#8217;s Q2 2022 database, down from 14 funds in the previous quarter. With 612,092 shares worth $2.2 million, Wexford Capital, owned by Charles Davidson, is the company&#8217;s biggest stakeholder.</p>



<p>Revlon, Inc. 6. (NYSE:REV)<br>Holders of Hedge Funds: 14</p>



<p>As of September 14, there was 28.13% short interest.</p>



<p>A New York-based firm called Revlon, Inc. (NYSE:REV) manufactures, distributes, and retails cosmetics and personal care items all over the globe. After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in mid-June, Revlon, Inc. (NYSE:REV) began to conduct a thorough financial restructuring of its historical capital structure in August with the goal of enhancing its long-term outlook. One of the finest short squeeze stocks to purchase right now is Revlon, Inc. (NYSE:REV).</p>



<p>At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 14 hedge funds were long Revlon, Inc. (NYSE:REV), compared to 36 funds the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey&#8217;s data. Marshall Wace LLP, owned by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace, have a large stake in the business, holding 301,758 shares worth $1.6 million.</p>



<p>Retail investors are pouring money into Revlon, Inc. (NYSE:REV) as short interest rises, joining other companies including Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND), Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY), and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC).</p>



<p>In their investor letter for Q2 2022, Mittleman Brothers said the following for Revlon, Inc. (NYSE:REV):</p>



<p>Last but not least, MIM has previously spoken on the June 15 bankruptcy filing by Revlon, Inc. (NYSE:REV); if you missed it, go here. MIM&#8217;s position remains the same: Bankruptcy of Revlon</p>



<p>Considering Chris&#8217; reduced estimate of fair value is $10, Revlon has since traded up from the pre-bankruptcy filing low of $1.08 on June 13 to above $9.00 on a few occasions, most recently on June 22 and August 1. During those two trading sessions, MIM sold a significant portion of its position at just over $9.00/share (down from the mid-20s). By only using the range of current market multiples, the realization might be far more than $10 per share if the bankruptcy procedure resulted in an auction of the assets. However, bankruptcy involves large expenses, uncertainties, and dangers that might muddle what is fair, therefore it makes sense to reduce the weighting into these cyclical price surges.</p>



<p>According to Chris&#8217; calculations, MIM still believes there are many purchasers for these assets who are willing to pay the 2x sales and 14x EBITDA multiples required for the stock to regain around $10 per share in value. The share price at 15x EBITDA would be about $16. $22 would equal 16x. Additionally, there are a few surprising new customers.</p>
