<p>In this article, we discuss 10 best global stocks to buy now.

<p>A strong U.S jobs market may actually make a recession more likely. Wall Street is concerned that the Fed could see additional hirings as an indication that the economy needs to be slowed down further to tame inflation. This could lead to more aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and elevates recessionary risk. Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments,&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-asia-sydney-tokyo-stock-markets-e2a789a50fddb88881bbd6931a99a134" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">told</a>&nbsp;<em>AP News</em>&nbsp;on October 8:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The employment situation is still good and that might be a little frustrating to the Fed. The Fed thinks we need more people unemployed in order to make sure inflation comes down and stays down.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/10/08/recession-watch-bear-market-deepens-as-fed-official-warns-rate-hikes-will-trigger-failures-around-global-economy/?sh=41b3f4d647e7" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">per</a>&nbsp;Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, there is &#8220;almost no evidence&#8221; that inflation has peaked, and the Fed is nowhere close to stopping rate hikes. He &#8220;fully&#8221; anticipates &#8220;some losses&#8221; and &#8220;some failures around the global economy&#8221; as markets react and adjust to the higher interest rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In these uncertain times, investors cannot put all their eggs in one basket and the need to diversify portfolios increases. It is a good idea to consider the best global stocks instead of going for American companies only. Some of the best global names include Accenture plc (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/accenture%20plc/1467373/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ACN</a>), Shell plc (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/shell%20plc/1306965/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">SHEL</a>), and Medtronic plc (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/medtronic%20plc/1613103/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">MDT</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Our Methodology&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>We selected the companies headquartered outside of the United States for this analysis, shortlisting stocks on the basis of positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, growth prospects, and solid hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter of 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14</em></strong></p>



<p>Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) is headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, and the company is engaged in the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages and soft drinks worldwide. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) sells its beverages under the Budweiser, Corona, Stella Artois, Bud Light, Castle, Castle Lite, and Skol brands. In Q2 2022, total sales volumes increased by 3.4%. There was a 9.7% increase in combined revenues of global brands – Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Corona, outside of their respective home markets.</p>



<p>On October 5, RBC Capital analyst James Edwardes Jones raised the price target on Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) to EUR 70 from EUR 64 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst noted that at current exchange rates, the weakness of the Euro and Pound versus the US Dollar, will contribute about $5 billion towards debt reduction in 2022. This should lower Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD)’s net debt to EBITDA ratio to approximately 3.3-times by the end of 2022 and &#8220;largely eliminate&#8221; one of investors&#8217; greatest turn-offs about the stock, as per the analyst.</p>



<p>According to Insider Monkey’s data, 14 hedge funds were long Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 20 funds in the last quarter. Ken Fisher’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/fisher-asset-management/11/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Fisher Asset Management</a>&nbsp;featured as the largest position holder in the company, with more than 9 million shares worth about $487 million.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“To make room for these new names and optimize the growth profile of the Strategy, we exited two additional positions during the quarter. We sold out of Anheuser-Busch InBev as we see too much work ahead for the world’s largest beer maker to re-ignite sales growth post COVID-19. While the company should benefit from a recovery in the on-premise channel, individual country complexities, the hedging of raw materials, and senior management turnover leave us more confident in the Strategy’s other reopening-related holdings.”</p>
