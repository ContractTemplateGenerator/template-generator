<p><strong><em>Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39</em></strong></p>



<p>Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a London-based energy and petrochemical corporation, is one of the best global stocks to buy now, with operations in Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, the United States, and the rest of the Americas.&nbsp;<em>Reuters</em>&nbsp;reported on October 5 that Qatar will include Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) as one of the partners in the second phase of the country’s massive liquefied natural gas expansion.</p>



<p>On September 12, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd raised the price target on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) to $80 from $75 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst remains constructive on the integrated oils sector, noting that near-record distillate margins continue to generate upside in refining estimates and will potentially do so through the winter and into an “equally tight” 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were long Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/fisher-asset-management/11/">Fisher Asset Management</a>&nbsp;held the leading stake in the company, consisting of 20.25 million shares worth over $1 billion.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”</p>

The company designs, manufactures, and sells vehicle components worldwide, in addition to offering electronic and safety technology solutions to the automotive and commercial vehicle markets. On September 13, Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) announced that it has agreed to acquire an 85% equity stake in Intercable Automotive Solutions, a subsidiary of Intercable, for €595 million.

<p>On September 28, Berenberg analyst Jared Maymon assumed coverage of Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) with a Buy rating and a $130 price target, citing the company’s sizable market share and its investments in high-voltage electrification, active safety, and user experience.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The acceleration in electrification of transport should support electric vehicle (EV)-related stocks like Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), which came under pressure in the quarter on concerns the auto cycle is past its peak. Aptiv provides a range of solutions for the auto industry, including autonomous driving technologies, safety technologies, components, and wiring. The large exposure of APTV to EVs should lead to long-term value as EVs continue their growth, boosted by their relative attractiveness as prices at the pump hit near-historic highs.”</p>

<p>According to Insider Monkey’s data, 47 hedge funds were long ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) at the end of June 2022, compared to 46 in the preceding quarter.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology.</p>



<p>Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward.</p>



<p>Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.”</p>

<p>According to Insider Monkey’s data, 54 hedge funds were long Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) at the end of June 2022, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/arrowstreet-capital/394/">Arrowstreet Capital</a>&nbsp;featured as the leading position holder in the company, with 3.8 million shares worth $338.3 million.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“While Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)’s procedure volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels, foreign exchange headwinds overshadowed underlying business value growth, and supply chain issues, including those related to China’s lockdowns, impacted the surgical innovations business. The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”</p>

<p>“Accenture plc provides consulting and technology services to corporate clients worldwide. Quarterly financial results exceeded Street expectations with 22% revenue growth and 23% operating income growth. However, shares fell 17.5% during the quarter due to adverse foreign currency movements weighing on next quarter’s guidance and investor concerns about macroeconomic uncertainty impacting client demand. We believe demand for Accenture’s services will be resilient over the long term and the company will continue gaining share in a large global market helping its clients digitally transform.”</p>
