<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LLC Interest.&nbsp; The LLC interest is personal property.&nbsp; A Member has no interest in property owned by the LLC.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encumbrance.&nbsp; A Member can encumber his LLC interest by a security interest or other form of collateral only with the consent of a majority of the other Members.&nbsp; Such consent shall only be given if the proceeds of the encumbrance are contributed to the LLC to respond to a cash call of the LLC.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sale of Interest.&nbsp; A Member can sell his LLC interest only as follows:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If a Member desires to sell his/her interest, in whole or in part, he/she shall give written notice to the LLC of his desire to sell all or part of his/her interest and must first offer the interest to the LLC.&nbsp; The LLC shall have the option to buy the offered interest at the then existing Set Price as provided in this Agreement.&nbsp; The LLC shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt of the assigning Member&#8217;s notice to give the assigning Member written notice of its intention to buy all, some, or none of the offered interest.&nbsp; The decision to buy shall be made by a majority of the other Members.&nbsp; Closing on the sale shall occur within sixty (60) days from the date that the LLC gives written notice of its intention to buy.&nbsp; The purchase price shall be paid in cash at closing unless the total purchase price is in excess of $_______________ in which event the purchase price shall be paid in __________ (____) equal quarterly installments beginning with the date of closing.&nbsp; The installment amounts shall be computed by applying the following interest factor to the principal amount: interest compounded quarterly at the Quarterly Federal Short-Term Rate existing at closing under the Applicable Federal Rates used for purposes of Internal Revenue Code § 1 274(d), or any successor provision.</li>
</ul>



<p>(b) To the extent the LLC does not buy the offered interest of the selling Member, the other Members shall have the option to buy the offered interest at the Set Price on a pro rata basis based on the Members&#8217; percentage interests at that time.&nbsp; If Member does not desire to buy up to his/her proportional part, the other Members can buy the remaining interest on the same pro rata basis. Members shall have fifteen (15) days from the date the LLC gives its written notice to the selling Member to give the selling Member notice in writing of their intention to buy all, some, or none of the offered interest.&nbsp; Closing on the sales shall occur within sixty (60) days from the date that the Members give written notice of their intention to buy.&nbsp; The purchase price from each purchasing Member shall be paid in cash at closing.</p>



<p>(c) To the extent the LLC or the Members do not buy the offered interest, the selling Member can then assign the interest to a non-member.&nbsp; The selling Member must close on the assignment within ninety (90) days of the date that he gave notice to the LLC.&nbsp; If he does not close by that time, he must again give the notice and options to the LLC and the LLC Members before he sells the interest.</p>



<p>(d) The selling Member must close on the assignment within ninety (90) days of the date that he gave notice to the LLC.&nbsp; If he does not close by that time, he must again give the notice and options to the LLC and the LLC Members before he sells the interest.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A non-member purchaser of a member’s interest cannot exercise any rights of a Member unless a majority of the non-selling Members consent to him becoming a Member.&nbsp; The non-member purchaser will be entitled, however, to share in such profits and losses, to receive such distributions, and to receive such allocation of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or similar items to which the selling member would be entitled, to the extent of the interest assigned, and will be subject to calls for contributions under the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp; The purchaser, by purchasing the selling member’s interest, agrees to be subject to all the terms of this Agreement as if he were a Member.</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Price.&nbsp; The Set Price for purposes of this Agreement shall be the price fixed by consent of a majority of the Members.&nbsp; The Set Price shall be memorialized and made a part of the LLC records.&nbsp; The initial Set Price for each Member&#8217;s interest is the amount of the Member&#8217;s contribution(s) to the LLC as provided above, as updated in accordance with the terms hereof.&nbsp; Any future changes in the Set Price by the Members shall be based upon net equity in the assets of the LLC (fair market value of the assets less outstanding indebtedness), considering the most recent appraisal obtained by the LLC for its assets, as may be adjusted by the Members in their discretion.&nbsp; The initial Set Price shall be adjusted upon demand by a Member but not more than once a year unless all Members consent.&nbsp; This basis for determining the Set Price shall remain in effect until changed by consent of a majority of the Members.&nbsp; The Members will consider revising the basis for determining the Set Price at least annually.</p>
