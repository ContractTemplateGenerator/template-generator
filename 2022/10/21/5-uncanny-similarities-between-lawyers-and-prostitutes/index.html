      <h1>5 uncanny similarities between lawyers and prostitutes</h1>

      <div class="content">
<p>A decade ago, I already covered scientific research that shows <a href="http://blog.thecorporateattorneys.com/2012/02/studies-lawyers-and-prostitutes-charge.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawyers and prostitutes charge the same</a>. At first glance, lawyers and prostitutes might not have much in common. But upon closer inspection, it&#8217;s easy to see that these two professions share a lot of key similarities. Here are just a few examples.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get this one out of the way first. It&#8217;s no secret that both lawyers and prostitutes are in it for the money. Sure, there are some exceptions to the rule (e.g., public defenders), but by and large, these are two professions that people enter into with the primary goal of making a financial killing.</p>

<p>No one really likes dealing with lawyers or prostitutes, but unfortunately, there are times when their services are necessary. Whether you&#8217;re going through a divorce or you&#8217;ve been accused of a crime, you&#8217;re probably not going to be too thrilled about hiring a lawyer. And let&#8217;s face it, most people would prefer not to have to pay for sex. But when the need arises, both lawyers and prostitutes are there to provide their services.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="3_They_Both_Have_To_Put_Up_With_A_Lot_Of_Crap_From_Their_Clients"></span>3. They Both Have To Put Up With A Lot Of Crap From Their Clients<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Dealing with clients can be a difficult task, no matter what industry you&#8217;re in. But lawyers and prostitutes arguably have it worse than most. They both have to deal with people who are often angry, frustrated, and disappointed with the results of their case/transaction. And because they&#8217;re both providing services that people don&#8217;t really want to use, they often have to put up with a lot of verbal abuse from their clients.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="4_They_Both_Have_To_Deal_With_The_Stigma_Of_Their_Profession"></span>4. They Both Have To Deal With The Stigma Of Their Profession<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Despite the fact that both lawyers and prostitutes are providing a service that people need, they both deal with a lot of stigma. Society tends to look down on both professions, and as a result, both lawyers and prostitutes often have to deal with a lot of negative stereotypes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="5_They_Both_Have_To_Be_Good_At_What_They_Do"></span>5. They Both Have To Be Good At What They Do<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Last but not least, it&#8217;s important to note that both lawyers and prostitutes have to be good at what they do. These are two professions where your success depends largely on your ability to perform. If you&#8217;re not good at your job, you&#8217;re not going to make much money. And in both professions, the competition is fierce, so you really have to be at the top of your game if you want to succeed.</p>



<p> So there you have it! These are just a few of the many similarities between lawyers and prostitutes. Sure, they may not be the most flattering comparison, but it&#8217;s undeniable that these two professions share more than a few commonalities.</p>
