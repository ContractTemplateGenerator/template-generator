<p>Like any business, ecommerce businesses can find themselves in disputes with customers, suppliers, employees, or independent contractors. An experienced ecommerce business lawyer can help you resolve these disputes through negotiation, mediation, or arbitration. In some cases, it may be necessary to go to court. However, before you do so, it&#8217;s important to consider whether or not settling the dispute is in your best interest.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Tips_for_avoiding_business_litigation"></span>Tips for avoiding business litigation<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h1>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="1_Have_clear_contracts"></span>1. Have clear contracts.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Having clear, well-written contracts is the best way to avoid disputes and litigation. Be sure to have an experienced lawyer review your contracts before you sign them, to ensure that they are clear and protect your interests.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="2_Communicate_with_your_customers_and_clients"></span>2. Communicate with your customers and clients.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Keep the lines of communication open with your customers and clients, and try to resolve any issues that arise as quickly as possible. The sooner you can resolve an issue, the less likely it is to escalate into a dispute.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="3_Be_proactive_about_preventing_disputes"></span>3. Be proactive about preventing disputes.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>There are some disputes that are simply unavoidable. But in many cases, disputes can be prevented by being proactive about identifying and addressing potential problems. If you&#8217;re aware of a potential issue, take steps to resolve it before it becomes a full-blown dispute.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="4_Avoid_going_into_business_with_friends_or_family"></span>4. Avoid going into business with friends or family.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Going into business with friends or family can be a recipe for disaster. These relationships are often fraught with emotion, and it can be difficult to resolve disputes when there is a personal relationship at stake. If you do go into business with friends or family, be sure to have clear contracts in place that spell out everyone&#8217;s roles and responsibilities, and establish ground rules for resolving disputes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="5_Be_prepared_for_litigation"></span>5. Be prepared for litigation.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>No matter how well you try to avoid it, there is always a possibility that you will end up in litigation. If that happens, be prepared. Have a clear understanding of the legal process, and be sure to have an experienced lawyer on your side.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="6_Incorporate_or_form_an_LLC"></span>6. Incorporate or form an LLC.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Just because a sole proprietor or a general partnership may open their doors to new business on the first day does not imply they should. Sole proprietors and partners may protect themselves from the firm&#8217;s responsibilities by forming a limited liability company (LLC) or limited liability partnership (LLP).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="7_Understand_the_fundamental_laws_that_apply_to_your_sector"></span>7. Understand the fundamental laws that apply to your sector.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>It seems simple, yet many companies fail because they did not complete their study. If your friends or family members are not certified professionals, do not depend on them to advise you on the &#8220;Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts&#8221; of business. Further study is also required if you want to do business across state or international boundaries, since taxes, customs, and laws differ depending on the location.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="8_Put_eveything_in_writing"></span>8. Put eveything in writing.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The only way to assure that your agreements, whether with an employee, customer, or vendor, are legally binding is to put them in writing. Far too many difficulties emerge when there is no documentation of the parties&#8217; agreement, resulting in a &#8220;he said, she said&#8221; scenario. Properly drafted agreements may include crucial terms and conditions, the parties&#8217; course of behavior and performance, necessary levels of communication, alternative dispute resolution, damages in the case of a violation by either party, and much more.</p>



<p>Simple forms, such as order confirmations, are available for free online. Investor agreements, purchase agreements, indemnity agreements, employment agreements, employee handbooks, independent contractor agreements, non-compete agreements, non-disclosure agreements, bills of sale, security agreements, franchise agreements, stock purchase agreements, and equipment or property leases, on the other hand, should all be created or at the very least reviewed by an attorney.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="9_Make_sure_youre_adequately_insured"></span>9. Make sure you&#8217;re adequately insured.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Why would you not cover your company if you have insurance for everything else in your life that is at risk? While prices might be preventive at the beginning, insurance is not something you want to overlook.</p>



<p>Company insurance plans may be customized to your unique business requirements, including coverage for resolving disputes without having to go to court.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="10_Keep_your_documents_secured"></span>10. Keep your documents secured.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The majority of firm records are stored digitally or online through a cloud-based storage solution. Make it a practice to secure your computers with the same care you would physical copies. Many businesses rely on computers as their lifeblood and most precise business asset.</p>



<p>Do not waste time or money attempting to repair a virus or bug on your computer system. Even worse, if personal information is lost or stolen as a result of a cyber-security incident. In the case of a computer problem, use preventive software such as antivirus and backup your information to safe cloud-based storage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="11_Make_plans_for_the_future"></span>11. Make plans for the future.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>How long would your company exist if anything happened to you? Do you have plans in place for company succession? Are there family members or workers who are skilled and qualified to run the firm in your absence?</p>



<p>These are all questions to consider in order to avoid the firm from failing while you are away. Having effective company succession plans in place eliminates future needless litigation between potential business heirs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="12_Speak_with_a_competent_business_lawyer"></span>12. Speak with a competent business lawyer.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>An attorney may assist your company with conception, formation, taxes, internet market, and compliance difficulties, as well as help your business avoid lawsuits in the long run, among other things. Most companies do not seek the advise of a lawyer until it is too late.</p>
