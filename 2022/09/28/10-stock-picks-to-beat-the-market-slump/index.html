<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>This article by <strong>Fatima Farooq</strong> with my picture is in <strong><a href="https://terms.law/?page_id=2549" data-type="page" data-id="2549">Yahoo</a> </strong></em></p>



<p>In this article, we will be taking a look at 10 stock picks to beat the market slump. To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and current market conditions.</p>



<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/08/17/stock-market-crash-isnt-over-according-to-indicator-with-perfect-track-record/?sh=e89831538bc3" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Forbes</a>, Bank of America analysts have expressed negative opinions on the current market condition this year. Prices are continuing to remain high in a time of inflation, and stocks have remained too expensive for most to consider investing in. The bear market feared at the onset of 2022 has thus become a prolonged reality for those in the investment world this year.</p>



<p>At the same time, many investors have continued to invest in profitable securities to beat the market slump diligently. Top picks for most individual and institutional investors have generally ranged within the technology and energy sectors, with stocks like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:<a href="http://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/exxon+mobil+corp/34088/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">XOM</a>), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:<a href="http://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/apple+inc/320193/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AAPL</a>), and QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:<a href="http://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/qualcomm+incde/804328/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">QCOM</a>) keeping investors satisfied. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/individual-investors-ramp-up-bets-on-tech-stocks-11659221897" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>&nbsp;this July, many individual investors are treating this as the time to double down on tech stocks. While the Nasdaq Composite Index fell by 21% from the start of 2022 to July, many investors remain hopeful for a rebound. Their hopes were answered eventually near the end of July, when the Nasdaq Composite Index rose by 12%, outperforming the broader S&amp;P 500 Index, which rose by 9.1%.</p>



<p>Similar outlooks can be spotted surrounding energy stocks in the midst of fuel-shortage risks. Many investors today are bullish on energy stocks. According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-11/looming-fuel-shortages-make-investors-bullish-on-energy-stocks-and-bonds" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, energy stocks rallied by over 40% from the start of 2022 to September, helped by surging profits from rising oil and gas prices. An MLIV Pulse survey conducted in the second week of September also showed that tw0-thirds of the respondents, consisting primarily of portfolio managers and retail investors, plan to increase their exposure to the energy sector over the next six months. In times of rampant inflation, with rate hikes continuing to haunt the market, the energy sector has become of the last remaining sanctuaries for investors today. The only way to beat the current market slump is to invest more in stocks that are still gaining, and energy stocks are among those few that have continued to gain even in the current market condition.</p>



<p>We can now take a look at the 10 stock picks to beat the market slump.</p>
