<p>In this article, we discuss 10 dividend stocks that raised their dividends in 2022. You can skip our detailed discussion on dividend stocks and their returns, and go directly to read&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/5-dividend-stocks-that-raised-their-dividends-in-2022-1069106/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">5 Dividend Stocks That Raised Their Dividends in 2022</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Given growing earnings, some companies are raising their payouts this year. According to the Janus Henderson Group, US dividend payments amounted to $144.4 billion in Q2, reaching their all-time high. In addition to this, global quarterly dividends also jumped 19.1% to $544.8 billion.</p>



<p>Many dividend stocks have declined less than the market, at least in the second quarter.&nbsp;While the MSCI World Index declined by 16.19% in Q2, the MSCI World High Dividend Yield Index fell by 8.72%, as reported by Allspring Global Investments.</p>



<p>When investing in dividend stocks, investors often gravitate towards companies that have decades-long dividend growth streaks. Dividend Aristocrats, the companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have raised their dividends for consecutive 25 years or more, are popular in this regard. These companies not only have proven records of dividend growth but also exhibit strong financials and balance sheets to support their payouts. Historically, Dividend Aristocrats have delivered higher yields than the wider market. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the average yield of S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats was 2.5% from 1998 to 2021, compared with a 1.8% yield of the S&amp;P 500.</p>



<p>Some of the most popular Dividend Aristocrats are Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/johnson%20%26%20johnson/200406/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">JNJ</a>), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/colgate%20palmolive%20co/21665/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">CL</a>), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/procter%20%26%20gamble%20co/80424/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PG</a>), as these companies maintain long dividend growth track records. Moreover, these companies have also raised their payouts this year.</p>



<p>Dividend stocks might not perform as well if interest rates continue to increase as the interest rate increases make the dividend yields less attractive. Furthermore, stocks could continue to fall if economic data doesn&#8217;t meet expectations. Nevertheless, there could be an opportunity for long term investors who invest in quality blue chip stocks given the lower valuations.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Our investment in&nbsp;<strong>Chubb</strong>&nbsp;began in the fourth quarter of 2015, shortly after ACE Limited announced it would acquire the Chubb Corporation, creating the largest global property and casualty insurance company by underwriting income. During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”</p>
