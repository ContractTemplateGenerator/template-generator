<p>This is in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/10-best-52-week-low-151719132.html" target="_blank">today&#8217;s Yahoo!News</a> with my photo.</p>



<p>Stock markets in the United States have been under pressure as inflation rose faster than expected in August 2022. According to the US Department of Labor, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.1% in August, compared to a consensus forecast of a 0.1% decrease. This strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark interest rate by 0.75% at its meeting next week. The increase in inflation comes at a time when supply chain challenges are easing around the world as a result of the relaxation of COVID-19-related lockdowns. Meanwhile, the labor market&#8217;s resilience, combined with the robust wage increase, indicates that inflation has not yet peaked. This will only encourage the Federal Reserve to take a more aggressive stance in order to reduce inflation and return it to its 2% year-on-year target. The CPI increased by 8.3% year on year in August. This means that the 12-month CPI has been higher than 8% for the past six months.</p>

<p>This is a troubling sign not only for the Federal Reserve, but also for the Biden administration and Democratic Party candidates running in the November 8 midterm elections. Observers believe that raging inflation will shift power to the Republican side of the House of Representatives. President Biden has stated that lowering inflation will take more time and determination. The Biden Administration recently passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which aims to reduce the cost of energy, healthcare, and prescription medications, easing the burden on the average American. According to some experts, the Federal Reserve and the US government are falling behind in controlling inflation and cooling the economy by taking the necessary measures. However, it should be noted that the Federal Reserve has already raised benchmark interest rates by 0.75% each in June and July, bringing the rate from near zero percent in March 2022 to a current range of 2.25% to 2.5%.</p>



<p>The labor market, on the other hand, is showing resilience. According to data released last week, the number of people applying for unemployment benefits has reached a three-month low. In August, there were two job openings for every unemployed person. These circumstances reflect a strong job market, which is allowing employees to keep their bargaining power and demand higher wages. Wage-spiral inflation is exacerbating inflationary pressures.</p>



<p>The higher-than-expected CPI also triggered a broader sell-off on September 13, with many stocks setting new 52-week lows. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) all suffered losses. Previously, the markets had closed in the green for four straight sessions. The sell-off presents an appealing opportunity for investors to go long in stocks with strong fundamentals and a positive outlook.</p>

<p>Latham Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWIM) is a leading North American designer, manufacturer, and marketer of in-ground residential swimming pools. The company ranks eighth on our list of the ten best 52-week low small-cap stocks to buy right now.</p>

<p>Holley Inc. (NYSE:HLLY) is an automotive performance company founded in 1896 in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Through its market-leading electronic fuel injection (EFI) products, the company specializes in advanced fuel-system designs.</p>



<p>In a research note to investors dated August 12, Michael Swartz at Truist set a $10 price target and reiterated a Buy rating on Holley Inc. (NYSE:HLLY) stock. The target price assumes a potential gain of over 75% from the 15 September closing price. The analyst concurred that the company&#8217;s second quarter results in 2022 were &#8220;not pretty.&#8221; However, Holley Inc.&#8217;s (NYSE:HLLY) difficulties over the past three months were temporary and should not have an effect on the company&#8217;s long-term outlook.

<p>&#8220;Another contributor was Holley, Inc., which designs, manufactures, and sells high-performance car and truck parts. The company&#8217;s loyal customer base, healthy margins, and specialized product offerings have enabled it to pass along higher costs and better withstand the effects of inflation, particularly in comparison to other companies that lack the same pricing power. Investors reacted favorably to Holley&#8217;s most recent round of acquisitions, which are anticipated to facilitate the company&#8217;s entry into new and sizable strategic markets. The most recent earnings report for Holley confirmed the company&#8217;s organic growth profile, bolstering confidence in the company&#8217;s future prospects. Holley is a former special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), and there have been general concerns regarding SPACs because they typically issue warrants (options to purchase stock at a fixed price) that can subsequently dilute shareholder ownership. Whenever we invest in a former SPAC, we incorporate the possibility of dilution into our analysis. Regarding Holley in particular, we maintained our optimistic outlook for the company last year, and it paid off in the first quarter of 2022.&#8221;</p>



<p>At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 15 hedge funds reported ownership of Holley Inc. (NYSE:HLLY) shares.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="4_Hillman_Solutions_Corporation_NASDAQ_HLMN"></span>4. Hillman Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:HLMN)<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Hillman Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:HLMN) is a Cincinnati-based provider of simple hardware solutions that serves the complex needs of its customers at 42,000 locations in the United States.</p>



<p>The analysts anticipated that Hillman Solutions Corp.&#8217;s (NASDAQ:HLMN) financial guidance for Q3 2022 and the full year 2022 would be lowered during the Q2 2022 earnings season to reflect the potential weakness observed in the home building and building product segment. In contrast to the consensus estimate of $1.5 billion, Hillman Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:HLMN) maintained its 2022 revenue guidance in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion when the company reported its Q2 2022 results on August 3. In addition, the firm maintained its free cash flow (FCF) guidance range of $120 million to $130 million. In the coming years, Hillman Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:HLMN) is expected to gain greater market share as it expands its product line.</p>



<p>In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments expressed its bullish outlook on Hillman Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:HLMN). Here&#8217;s what the company stated:</p>



<p>The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, according to Ben Graham&#8217;s alleged assessment. In 2021, we observed votes cast against companies based solely on how and when they raised capital, as if the choice of financing vehicle supersedes the underlying business&#8217;s long-term value creation. The Class of 2021 Initial Public Offerings and companies that raised capital by merging with Special-Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) were two such areas that hindered the performance of the Strategy. As the &#8220;weighting machine&#8221; resumes operation, we anticipate that the value of each of the businesses underlying these holdings will be reflected over time. Of course, many IPOs and SPAC acquisitions involved immature businesses — often merely concepts — that shouldn&#8217;t be public, but with so many deals completed, there are bound to be a few gems.</p>



<p>Midway through 2021, Hillman Solutions completed the process of merging with Landcadia Holdings III (a SPAC). Hillman is a distributor of hardware and provider of automation tools (such as key making and knife sharpening) to U.S. retailers. In the short term, supply chain issues have impacted the business, while bearish investors appear to be focused on the treatment of warrants related to SPACs. Given the quality and labor alternatives offered by its services, Hillman is well-positioned to continue expanding over the long term. Despite a recent decline, Hillman&#8217;s fill rates (i.e., in-stock inventory) remain the highest in the industry, which should result in gains in market share and the possible entry into additional product categories. Hillman&#8217;s business model, which entails taking over inventory, distribution, and floor staffing, as well as automated self-service kiosks, helps to alleviate one of the most significant pressure points in its customers&#8217; businesses: labor. In contrast, the future growth and profitability expectations reflected in Hillman&#8217;s current stock price are extremely modest relative to the company&#8217;s potential.</p>
