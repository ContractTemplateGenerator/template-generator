# California Employment Agreements: A Comprehensive Guide for Employers

In today's complex business environment, having a solid employment agreement is essential for California employers. Whether you're a tech startup in Silicon Valley, an established business in Los Angeles, or a remote company hiring California employees, a well-drafted employment agreement provides clarity, sets expectations, and helps prevent costly disputes down the road.

The California Employment Agreement Generator above is designed to help you create a customized employment agreement that complies with California's unique employment laws. This tool enables you to easily craft an agreement tailored to your specific needs, but understanding the legal principles behind these agreements is equally important.

## Why California Employment Agreements Matter

California has some of the most employee-friendly laws in the nation. From specific overtime requirements to strict regulations on non-compete agreements, California employment law contains numerous provisions that differ significantly from other states. These unique aspects make having a properly tailored California employment agreement crucial.

An employment agreement serves several important purposes:

1. It clarifies the employment relationship, duties, and expectations
2. It establishes compensation structure and benefits
3. It protects your confidential information and intellectual property
4. It sets out procedures for termination and dispute resolution

Without a clear, written agreement, employers face increased risks of misunderstandings, disputes, and potentially costly litigation. A properly drafted employment agreement helps protect both the employer and the employee by establishing clear terms that comply with California law.

## Key Components of California Employment Agreements

### Employment Status and At-Will Employment

California is an "at-will" employment state, which means that either the employer or the employee can terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. This is the default employment status in California unless specified otherwise.

Including an at-will employment provision in your agreement is generally advisable, as it preserves your flexibility as an employer. However, including this provision doesn't mean you can terminate employees for illegal reasons, such as discrimination or retaliation. California law still prohibits terminations that violate public policy, anti-discrimination laws, or other worker protections.

Some employers choose to include a probationary period in their employment agreements. While this doesn't change the at-will nature of employment, it can set expectations for an initial evaluation period. Be aware that prolonged probationary periods may create implied promises of continued employment after the probation ends, so careful wording is essential.

### Job Duties and Expectations

Clearly outlining job duties and expectations is critical for both legal protection and practical management. A well-defined job description helps:

- Set clear performance expectations
- Determine exempt versus non-exempt status
- Evaluate reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities
- Assess whether employees are performing their duties satisfactorily

When drafting this section, be specific enough to provide clarity but flexible enough to accommodate business changes. Including language that permits modification of duties based on business needs can help maintain necessary flexibility.

### Compensation and Benefits

California has specific requirements regarding compensation that must be reflected in your employment agreements. These include:

#### Minimum Wage and Overtime

As of 2025, California's minimum wage is $16.00 per hour for all employers. Some localities have higher minimum wages, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles. Your employment agreement should specify a wage rate that meets or exceeds the applicable minimum wage.

For non-exempt employees, California requires overtime pay at 1.5 times the regular rate for hours worked beyond 8 in a day or 40 in a week, and double time for hours worked beyond 12 in a day or 8 on the seventh consecutive workday in a workweek. Your agreement should clearly state whether the employee is exempt or non-exempt and include appropriate overtime provisions for non-exempt employees.

#### Salary and Commission Structures

For salaried employees, specify whether they are exempt from overtime requirements and clearly state their salary basis (e.g., annual, monthly). If an employee receives commissions, the agreement should detail the commission structure, including calculation methods, timing of payment, and any conditions for earning commissions.

Under California law, commission agreements must be in writing and signed by the employee. While this can be included in the employment agreement, the terms must be clear and specific.

#### Benefits

Your employment agreement should address employee benefits, including:

- Health insurance (if offered)
- Retirement plans (if offered)
- Paid time off (PTO)
- Sick leave
- Other benefits

California requires employers to provide a minimum of 24 hours (3 days) of paid sick leave per year, and some localities require more. Your agreement should reflect compliance with these requirements.

### Intellectual Property and Confidentiality

For many employers, especially in the technology sector, protecting intellectual property (IP) and confidential information is a critical concern. California law allows employers to require employees to assign inventions created during employment to the employer, but with important limitations.

#### California Labor Code Section 2870

California Labor Code Section 2870 limits an employer's ability to claim ownership of an employee's inventions. Specifically, an employer cannot require an employee to assign inventions that the employee developed:

1. Entirely on their own time
2. Without using the employer's equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information

Unless the invention either:
1. Relates to the employer's business or anticipated research/development
2. Results from work performed by the employee for the employer

Your employment agreement should include IP assignment provisions that comply with Section 2870 and explicitly reference this law.

#### Confidentiality Provisions

Employment agreements commonly include confidentiality provisions to protect the employer's trade secrets and confidential information. These provisions should:

- Clearly define what constitutes confidential information
- Specify the employee's obligations to maintain confidentiality
- Address the return of confidential information upon termination
- Comply with whistleblower protections, including the Defend Trade Secrets Act notice

Remember that overly broad confidentiality provisions may be unenforceable in California, particularly if they prevent employees from using general skills and knowledge in subsequent employment.

### Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation

This is one area where California law differs dramatically from many other states.

#### Non-Compete Agreements

California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 prohibits non-compete agreements in the employment context, with very limited exceptions. Unlike many other states, California strongly favors employee mobility and generally will not enforce restrictions on an employee's ability to work for competitors after leaving your company.

Any attempt to include a traditional non-compete clause in a California employment agreement is likely unenforceable and could potentially expose the employer to liability, including unfair competition claims. Do not include non-compete clauses in your California employment agreements.

Recent legislation (AB 1076 and SB 699) has further strengthened California's prohibition on non-competes. These laws, effective January 1, 2024, reaffirm that non-compete agreements are void in California and create additional penalties for employers who attempt to enforce them.

#### Non-Solicitation of Customers

California courts have generally treated customer non-solicitation provisions as a form of non-compete agreement, rendering them unenforceable in most circumstances. While narrow provisions protecting trade secrets may be permissible, broader restrictions on soliciting customers are likely invalid.

#### Non-Solicitation of Employees

California courts have increasingly scrutinized employee non-solicitation provisions as well. In AMN Healthcare, Inc. v. Aya Healthcare Services, Inc. (2018), a California appellate court held that an employee non-solicitation provision was unenforceable under Section 16600. While some narrow employee non-solicitation provisions may still be permissible in certain contexts, this is a rapidly evolving area of law, and caution is warranted.

### Dispute Resolution

How disputes will be resolved is an important consideration in any employment agreement. There are several options, each with advantages and disadvantages.

#### Arbitration Clauses

Arbitration clauses require employment disputes to be resolved through binding arbitration rather than litigation in court. While federal law generally supports the enforceability of arbitration agreements, California has specific requirements for employment arbitration agreements to be valid.

Under California law, employment arbitration agreements must:

- Be conscionable (fair in terms of process and substance)
- Not deprive employees of substantive rights
- Provide for a neutral arbitrator
- Allow for adequate discovery
- Require a written decision
- Have the employer pay all costs unique to arbitration

Additionally, the agreement cannot require employees to waive their right to:
- Bring representative actions under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA)
- Seek public injunctive relief
- File complaints with administrative agencies

If you choose to include an arbitration provision, ensure it meets these requirements. Some employers prefer to have disputes resolved in court rather than through arbitration, particularly given the evolving legal landscape surrounding employment arbitration agreements.

#### Governing Law and Venue

Employment agreements typically specify the governing law (usually California law for employees working in California) and venue for disputes. While choice of law provisions can be valid in some contexts, California courts will generally apply California law to employment relationships substantially connected to California, regardless of contract language to the contrary.

## Special Considerations for Different Types of Employees

Employment agreements should be tailored to the specific type of employee. Here are some special considerations for different categories:

### Executives and Senior Management

For executives and senior management, employment agreements often include more detailed provisions regarding:

- Performance metrics and evaluation
- Equity compensation (stock options, restricted stock, etc.)
- Severance packages
- Change of control provisions
- Board seats or observer rights (if applicable)

These agreements typically require more negotiation and customization than agreements for other employees.

### Sales Employees

For sales employees, commission structures are particularly important. California law requires commission agreements to be in writing and to clearly state:

- How commissions are calculated
- When commissions are earned
- When commissions are paid
- The effect of termination on pending commissions

Additionally, California prohibits employers from reclaiming commissions that have already been paid, except in limited circumstances.

### Remote Workers

With the rise of remote work, many California employers now hire employees who work from home or other remote locations. For remote employees, employment agreements should address:

- Work location expectations
- Equipment and expense reimbursement
- Work schedule and availability
- Communication requirements
- Data security and confidentiality

Remember that California labor laws apply to remote employees working in California, even if the employer is based elsewhere.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

When creating employment agreements for California employees, avoid these common pitfalls:

### Including Unenforceable Provisions

Including provisions that are unenforceable under California law (such as non-compete clauses) can:
- Create confusion
- Undermine the validity of other provisions
- Potentially expose the employer to liability

Always ensure your agreement complies with current California law.

### Failing to Address California-Specific Requirements

California has unique requirements in areas such as:
- Overtime calculations
- Meal and rest breaks
- Expense reimbursement
- Paid sick leave

Failing to address these requirements in your employment agreement (or having provisions that contradict them) can lead to compliance issues.

### Overly Restrictive Confidentiality Provisions

Overly broad confidentiality provisions that prevent employees from using their general skills and knowledge in future employment may be unenforceable in California. In Brown v. TGS Management Co. (2020), a California court invalidated a confidentiality provision that was so broad it effectively operated as a non-compete agreement.

Ensure your confidentiality provisions focus on protecting legitimate trade secrets and confidential information, not restricting employee mobility.

### Inconsistency with Other Documents

Employment agreements should be consistent with other employment documents, such as:
- Offer letters
- Employee handbooks
- Company policies
- Equity plans

Inconsistencies between these documents can create confusion and potential legal issues.

## Best Practices for California Employment Agreements

To create effective and compliant employment agreements for California employees, follow these best practices:

### Regular Review and Updates

Employment laws change frequently, particularly in California. Review your employment agreements regularly and update them as needed to ensure continued compliance with current law.

### Clear and Specific Language

Use clear, specific language that both parties can easily understand. Avoid legalese and ambiguity where possible. Clearly define important terms and concepts.

### Tailor to Specific Roles

While templates can be useful starting points, employment agreements should be tailored to the specific role and circumstances of each employee. One-size-fits-all approaches often fail to address important nuances.

### Consider Business Needs and Culture

Your employment agreement should reflect not only legal requirements but also your business needs and company culture. For example, if your company values flexibility, your agreement might emphasize remote work options or flexible scheduling.

## Implementation Tips

Once you've created your employment agreement, follow these tips for effective implementation:

### Proper Execution

Ensure the agreement is properly executed by all parties. Both the employer and employee should sign and date the agreement. Electronic signatures are generally valid in California under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

### Provide Copies to Employees

Provide a copy of the signed agreement to the employee for their records. This helps prevent later disputes about what was agreed upon.

### Consistent Application

Apply your employment agreement practices consistently to avoid claims of discrimination or unfair treatment. If different employees in similar positions have significantly different agreements, be sure there are legitimate business reasons for the differences.

### Document Changes or Amendments

If the employment relationship changes over time (e.g., promotions, changes in compensation, etc.), document these changes through formal amendments to the agreement rather than relying on verbal understandings.

## The Future of California Employment Law

California employment law continues to evolve, with new legislation and court decisions regularly affecting employment agreements. Some trends to watch include:

### Increased Protection for Workers

California's legislature has consistently expanded worker protections in recent years, from strengthening anti-discrimination laws to limiting arbitration agreements and confidentiality provisions in certain contexts.

### Remote Work Regulations

As remote work becomes more common, California is likely to develop more specific regulations addressing remote work arrangements, including issues like expense reimbursement and workplace safety for remote employees.

### Pay Transparency and Equity

California has increasingly focused on pay transparency and equity, with laws requiring pay scale disclosures in job postings and prohibiting questions about salary history. These trends may continue to expand.

### Algorithmic Decision-Making and AI

As employers increasingly use algorithms and artificial intelligence in employment decisions, California may develop regulations addressing these technologies to prevent discrimination and ensure transparency.

Staying informed about these and other developments is essential for maintaining compliant employment agreements.

## FAQ: California Employment Agreements

### Can I include a non-compete clause if I limit it to a short duration or small geographic area?

No. Unlike many other states, California generally prohibits non-compete agreements regardless of their duration or geographic scope. With very limited exceptions (such as in connection with the sale of a business), non-compete clauses are unenforceable in California.

### If my company is based outside California but employs California residents, do California laws apply to those employment relationships?

Generally, yes. California courts typically apply California employment law to employees working in California, regardless of where the employer is based or what the employment agreement says about governing law. This can create compliance challenges for multi-state employers, who may need different agreements for their California employees.

### How specific should job duties be in an employment agreement?

The level of specificity depends on the position and your goals. More specific descriptions help clarify expectations but can limit flexibility. I generally recommend including core responsibilities while allowing for reasonable changes based on business needs. For executive positions, broader descriptions are common, while more specialized roles may benefit from greater specificity.

### Can I modify an employment agreement after it's been signed?

Yes, but any modifications require the consent of both parties. Unilateral changes to material terms (such as compensation or duties) can constitute a breach of contract or even a constructive discharge. Document any changes through a formal amendment signed by both parties.

### Is it better to have a separate confidentiality agreement or include confidentiality provisions in the employment agreement?

Either approach can work. Including confidentiality provisions in the employment agreement simplifies paperwork, while a separate agreement allows for more detailed provisions and may be easier to update as needs change. For highly sensitive positions, a separate, more detailed confidentiality agreement may be preferable.

### How often should I update my employment agreements?

I recommend reviewing your employment agreement templates at least annually and updating them whenever significant changes occur in the law or your business practices. For existing employees, material changes to their agreements should be documented through amendments.

### Can I require employees to sign arbitration agreements in California?

Yes, but with limitations. Arbitration agreements in California employment contracts must meet specific requirements to be enforceable, including procedural and substantive fairness. Additionally, they cannot require employees to waive certain rights, such as bringing PAGA claims or seeking public injunctive relief.

### What happens if part of my employment agreement is found to be unenforceable?

This depends on the specific circumstances and the agreement's severability clause. A well-drafted severability clause allows the remainder of the agreement to stand even if certain provisions are invalid. However, particularly problematic provisions (like non-competes) can sometimes taint the entire agreement or related provisions.

### Can I specify that laws of another state govern the employment agreement?

While you can include such a provision, California courts will generally apply California law to employment relationships substantially connected to California, regardless of the agreement's choice of law provision. This is particularly true for laws reflecting California's strong public policy, such as the prohibition on non-compete agreements.

### Should I include specific grounds for termination in the agreement, or rely on at-will employment?

This depends on your goals. Specifying grounds for termination can limit your flexibility under at-will employment but may provide clarity for employees and protection against certain claims. For most non-executive employees, a simple at-will provision is often sufficient, while executive agreements more commonly include specific termination provisions.

### How should I handle remote employees who move to California after being hired?

When employees relocate to California, California employment laws generally begin to apply to the employment relationship, regardless of the original agreement's terms. Consider implementing a policy requiring employees to notify you of relocation and updating their employment agreements accordingly.

## Final Thoughts

A well-drafted employment agreement provides clarity and protection for both employers and employees. By understanding California's unique employment laws and following best practices, you can create agreements that not only comply with legal requirements but also support your business goals and workplace culture.

The California Employment Agreement Generator above provides a solid starting point, but remember that employment law is complex and constantly evolving.
