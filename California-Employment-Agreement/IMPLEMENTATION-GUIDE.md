# California Employment Agreement Generator - Implementation Instructions

Due to the size and complexity of the enhanced California Employment Agreement Generator, the updates have been split into multiple files for easier implementation. Follow these instructions to properly incorporate all updates:

## 1. Main JavaScript File Updates

The main `california-employment-agreement.js` file has been updated with:
- Enhanced form data state with additional California-specific fields
- Updated tab configuration including new Remote Work, COVID-19, and Policies tabs
- Updated section pattern matching for highlighting
- Enhanced document generation function with comprehensive California provisions

Because the file is quite large, you may need to manually copy sections from the original file and replace them with the corresponding enhanced sections.

## 2. Additional Files

Several additional files have been created to help with the implementation:

### finalize-tab-updates.js
Contains the enhanced Finalize tab content with California-specific legal disclaimers and consultation information. Add this content to the `renderTabContent` function's case 11.

### react-render-code.js
Contains the updated ReactDOM rendering code for proper initialization of Feather icons. Replace the existing rendering code at the end of the main file with this content.

### california-tooltips.js
Contains additional tooltip components and California-specific helper text. You can incorporate these as needed throughout the form for enhanced user guidance.

## 3. CSS Updates

The `styles.css` file has been enhanced with additional styles for:
- California law alerts
- Enhanced tooltips
- Improved form styling
- Better tab navigation
- Updated button styles

## 4. Implementation Options

If you encounter difficulties updating the main JavaScript file due to its size, consider these options:

1. Create a new file and build the complete generator from scratch, incorporating all enhanced elements
2. Split the main JavaScript file into smaller component files (e.g., tabs, form logic, document generation)
3. Use a code editor with better large file support to make the updates directly

## 5. Testing

After implementation, test the following:
- All form fields and tabs should work correctly
- California-specific tooltips and information should display properly
- Live preview should highlight changed content correctly
- The generated document should include all California-specific provisions
- Word document download and copy to clipboard should work
