Hi Wendy,

Thank you for the careful review and the kind words. I've made all three corrections:

1. Salesman name — Changed "Adam Roberts" to "Manuel Garcia" throughout the letter

2. Cost increase — Updated to show 35.8% actual increase (25.8% after your 10% auto-pay discount). This actually strengthens the argument — you're paying MORE despite getting a discount.

3. Hold time documentation — Changed to "one documented call of several calls where she remained on hold for 2 hours and 48 minutes." Good instinct to note you have multiple documented calls — we'll keep the additional screenshots as evidence for later if needed.

Regarding the Enphase renewal fee you paid ($147.99) — that's actually helpful context. It shows you're being forced to pay out-of-pocket for services that should arguably be covered under the PPA, and it demonstrates the "estimation" threat they hold over customers who don't maintain monitoring. I may reference this in future correspondence.

The updated letter is ready for your final review. Let me know if anything else needs adjustment before we send.

Best,
Sergei
