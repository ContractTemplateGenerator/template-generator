Cole — thank you for inviting me to bid, I appreciate it.

I’m a corporate lawyer with 14+ years of experience and can deliver the California-law research memo you described: third-party limitations on claims against insurers, post-settlement exceptions and alternative theories, liability arising from post-settlement conduct/representations, reliance/causation analysis tied to foreclosure and consequential damages, and a well-cited authorities section (statutes + controlling case law), written in a litigation-firm pitch format.

I can start immediately upon hiring.

I also maintain a focused hub page that mirrors the structure of the memo you’re requesting (issue map + scenario navigation + case law/authorities tab + evidence checklist): [https://terms.law/Blog/california-insurance-settlement-claims/](https://terms.law/Blog/california-insurance-settlement-claims/) This can be used to quickly see my legal writing style and how I frame these issues for attorney review.

Should you wish to jump on a quick call to discuss this further before hiring, you can schedule at this calendar: (https://www.upwork.com/services/product/consulting-hr-sergei-1482307285342826496)

Sincerely, Sergei Tokmakov, Esq. California State Bar: 279869

I am seeking an experienced attorney or senior legal researcher to prepare a legal research memo analyzing potential claims arising from an insurance settlement issue that led to a foreclosure in California.

This is a research and strategy project only - it will not involve any litigation. The memo will be used to evaluate and pitch the case to a litigation firm, so it must be accurate, well-cited, and thoughtfully reasoned under California law.

All detailed facts, documents, and timelines will be provided after engagement.

The memo should address, at a minimum:

1) California law governing third-party claims against insurers

2) Exceptions and alternative theories that may apply once a settlement exists

3) Legal exposure arising from post-settlement conduct or representations

4) Reliance, causation, and consequential damages concepts under CA law

5) Relevant statutes and case law

6) Practical considerations for how such claims are framed and evaluated by litigation firms

Length and format are flexible, but the work should be client-ready and suitable for attorney review. This is a legal research and analysis project.

** You must be an Attorney, but you do not need to be licensed in California for this role - we just need someone capable of researching the above-referenced laws/issues. **

Hi Sergei,

Hope all is well — I look forward to working with you!

See below:

Here is a link to the Google Drive containing the background and supporting documentation related to this situation: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Em6WQe0Q-6WeWIfxaIz7i9jMKi7ooGZJ?usp=drive_link

My main focus is on the following:

Claim(s) against the insurance company -

Do I have any remedies against the insurance company in the form of a bad faith case? I understand that it is difficult to sue a 3rd party insurance company for bad faith in California, but are there any other potential causes of action? Promissory fraud, negligent misrepresentation? Am I entitled to consequential damages? Punitive damages?

Claim against the foreclosing lender -

Did the Lender send valid notices? Was the sale defective? The Lender accepted partial payments in exchange for postponing the auction date after the Notice of Default and Notice of Trustee’s Sale – how does that affect the acceleration of the loan?

Any remedies under SB 1079?

The winning bidder completed an owner-occupant affidavit (according to the Trustee) timely, but they have since advertised the property as “bank owned” and listed it for auction until December 28 (which is obviously unusual for someone who claims they will be occupying the home as their primary residence). Can the owner-occupant affidavit be challenged if it turns out the buyer is an investor and is using the property for investment purposes? If so, what is the deadline to to take action and how? When does the sale become final if we prevail on this argument?

Do I have any other remedies available?

Thanks! Cole
