We have 24 hours to review a contract from Thoughtspot. They’ve offered us a fairly lucrative deal pending fast turnaround on this agreement so we’re under a time crunch. I want to make sure that our customer’s data is safe - we are using Thoughtspot’s platform for reporting and AI data processing for our customers’ data. Additionally want to make sure there aren’t any predatory terms we should be concerned about. Fast contract turnaround comes with risk, can you help us derisk? Or at least counter any unreasonable agreement terms with reasonable ones?

Hi Niki,

I know it's urgent, so moving quickly.

From the documents you forwarded, Salve is signing up for ThoughtSpot’s “Embedded Enterprise Edition” to power the analytics layer of your own platform. The order form covers six orgs for a 12-month term at a net Year-1 price of $45,000, invoiced quarterly, and bundles 30,000 Spotter credits plus a fixed-fee “Jumpstart AI” consulting package .

Your business goal seems clear: deploy ThoughtSpot quickly so your customers can query their own data while ensuring (i) their personal data stays safe, and (ii) the commercial terms do not expose Salve to outsized risk .

Key findings and recommendations

Data scope and protections. T he DPA states that ThoughtSpot processes only “Administrative Information” (user names, log-ins, search tokens) as a processor; all other data you ingest into your own warehouse remains outside its definition of “Personal Data.” That means the DPA’s security, breach-notification, and deletion commitments do not automatically apply to the customer data sets you will surface through embedded analytics. If those sets contain any regulated personal information, we should extend the DPA’s coverage (or attach our own rider) so ThoughtSpot’s SSAE-18 / ISO-27001 controls apply to the full analytic data stream and not solely to log-ins .

International transfers and subprocessors. Cross-border flows rely first on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and fall back to the 2021 SCCs if that framework is struck down. ThoughtSpot can add or replace subprocessors on “general written authorization,” with 30 days to object . If your customers are in the EU/UK or handle sensitive health-related data, we should (a) subscribe to the sub-processor notification feed and (b) insert language that lets Salve terminate for convenience if a critical sub-processor cannot be vetted or refuses to sign equivalent SCCs.

Commercial risk allocation. Indemnity runs only one way and only for third-party IP infringement . There is no indemnity for security incidents or breach of confidentiality, yet the liability cap for all claims (including a data breach) is the amount Salve pays in the 12 months before the claim arises . If you put substantial PII in the service, a single breach could exceed that cap. Request either a separate “super-cap” for data-breach liabilities (e.g., 3× fees or a fixed dollar amount) or have ThoughtSpot confirm it carries adequate cyber-liability coverage naming Salve as an additional insured.

Suspension and hidden cost triggers. ThoughtSpot may suspend the service for any payment that is 30 days past due or if it “reasonably” believes your use threatens its infrastructure . Because invoices go out quarterly, a dispute over a single consulting milestone could halt the entire platform. Best practice is to add a cure period tied to undisputed fees only and to require written notice with a reasonable window to remediate any alleged security issue before suspension.

Future-purchase options and price escalators. The order form offers attractive tiered pricing for extra orgs (down to $10k per 5-org bundle once you exceed 100 orgs) . That is helpful, but the CSA is silent on renewal pricing. We should insert a cap—e.g., renewals will not exceed the greater of CPI + 3 % or 5 % year-over-year—to avoid sticker shock in year 2.

Warranties and SLAs. The uptime commitment is embedded in the Program Guide rather than the CSA; outages only give you service credits, not termination rights. If analytics uptime is mission-critical, we should either (a) negotiate credits that escalate in value at lower uptime thresholds or (b) add an express right to terminate if availability drops below 98 % in any two consecutive months.

Practical next steps

1. Decide whether customer data visible in ThoughtSpot will contain regulated personal data. If so, we need a broader definition of “Personal Data” in the DPA and stronger breach indemnity language. 2. Confirm your projected org-growth curve; that will tell us whether the optional org pricing is really favorable or whether we should lock in a bigger discount up front. 3. Let me know if quarterly invoicing is acceptable or if you’d prefer monthly billing to smooth cash flow and lower the suspension risk. 4. Provide any internal security or insurance thresholds Salve must meet so I can mirror them in the vendor’s obligations.

Questions for you that'll help me finetune the analysis, if you want:

* Do you anticipate hosting any HIPAA-covered PHI, GDPR special-category data, or California “sensitive personal information” in ThoughtSpot? * What is your internal tolerance for liability caps on SaaS vendors that hold client data—are you comfortable with two-times annual fees, or do you require a higher fixed cap? -Can Salve’s engineers live with a pure service-credit remedy for downtime, or do they need a termination-for-cause trigger tied to sustained SLA breaches ? * Finally, what is the earliest go-live date you have promised to your customers? That will drive how hard we push on each point versus accepting short-term concessions and renegotiating at renewal.

Best, Sergei

You, Sir, are worth your weight in gold. I cannot thank you enough — your assessment is as efficient as it is brilliant. I will be back once we have time to review these matters with ThoughtSpot, which we're doing right now.
Friday, May 02


Niki Rogers
7:30 AM
Happy Friday Sergei! We got responses to your points I'm going to paste below. Would love to get your feedback before we put the official wording in the next agreement.

3. Data Scope & Protections: The DPA states that ThoughtSpot processes only "Administrative Information" (user names, log-ins, search tokens) as a processor; all other data you ingest into your own warehouse remains outside its definition of "Personal Data." That means the DPA's security, breach-notification, and deletion commitments do not automatically apply to the customer data sets you will surface through embedded analytics. If those sets contain any regulated personal information, we should extend the DPA's coverage (or attach our own rider) so ThoughtSpot's SSAE-18 / ISO-27001 controls apply to the full analytic data stream and not solely to log-ins .

Administrative Information covers all information submitted to the platform by a customer's use of the platform. For clarity, ThoughtSpot is offering access to a SaaS application hosted on AWS that has generally-applicable search and visualization functionalities. Data remains stored in a data warehouse of the customer’s choosing (e.g., Snowflake), and searches are executed in the data warehouses. Search results (visualizations) are not stored on the ThoughtSpot service, but reconstructed in the user’s browser when a user clicks to view a visualization. Data available for search is not moved to the ThoughtSpot service. Each customer further has the opportunity to identify what data it wants to index and tokenize for use in the predictive search bar, if any. Data is stored in a non-relational database and encrypted in transit and at rest.

ThoughtSpot is not acting as a data backup service or a data repository. All data remains within the customer cloud data warehouse. ThoughtSpot, like the industry at large, does not provide a general indemnity for a breach of the DPA, security incidents, or confidentiality because ThoughtSpot does not qualify, review, or make decisions about a customer’s use of query tokens, the length of time such query tokens are used, whether they include personal data, whether they were properly collected, or how they are managed. Any customer personal data remains stored in the customer’s own data warehouse while searches are executed. Search results and visualizations are not stored in ThoughtSpot, but reconstructed in the user’s browser as a user clicks to view a visualization.

4. Commercial risk allocation: Indemnity runs only one way and only for third-party IP infringement . There is no indemnity for security incidents or breach of confidentiality, yet the liability cap for all claims (including a data breach) is the amount Salve pays in the 12 months before the claim arises . If you put substantial PII in the service, a single breach could exceed that cap. Request either a separate "super-cap" for data-breach liabilities (e.g., 3× fees or a fixed dollar amount) or have ThoughtSpot confirm it carries adequate cyber-liability coverage naming Salve as an additional insured. ThoughtSpot will allow for a 3x super cap on the order form

5. Suspension and hidden cost triggers: ThoughtSpot may suspend the service for any payment that is 30 days past due or if it "reasonably" believes your use threatens its infrastructure . Because invoices go out quarterly, a dispute could halt the entire platform. Best practice is to add a cure period tied to undisputed fees only and to require written notice with a reasonable window to remediate any alleged issue before suspension.

ThoughtSpot is unable to provide non-paying customers with continued access to the platform. Any non-payments would certainly be followed up by ThoughtSpot with the customer team to understand whether there was a miscommunication or error in payment.

6. Future-purchase options and price escalators: The order form offers attractive tiered pricing for extra orgs (down to $10k per 5-org bundle once you exceed 100 orgs) . That is helpful, but the CSA is silent on renewal pricing. Thoughtspot will include language around renewal and impact.

7. Warranties and SLAs: The uptime commitment is embedded in the Program Guide rather than the CSA; outages only give you service credits, not termination rights. We need the right to terminate if availability drops below 98% over 2 consecutive months. Will add to order form: "In the event that ThoughtSpot fails to meet the Service Level for three months in any consecutive six-month period, Customer may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to ThoughtSpot within 30 days of ThoughtSpot's failure to meet the Service Level and, as Customer’s exclusive remedy, ThoughtSpot shall refund to Customer any prepaid subscription fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term after the effective date of termination. Any unapplied service credits or extension periods granted to Customer per this Section with respect to the Service Level shall expire unused with no further credit or refund and shall have no cash value."

Finally, is there anything we an do to add wording that would allow us to get out of the contract if our company gets purchased or goes bankrupt? Or even more so, maybe a way to buy out of the agreement?

Sergei Tokmakov
5:31 PM
Hi Niki,

My read of ThoughtSpot’s counter-proposal

From their reply they’re saying: “Because we never copy or store your analytic data, we’re really just a query engine. Therefore we’re only willing to treat the sliver of information that actually touches our cloud—login credentials, query tokens, index metadata—as ‘Personal Data’ under the DPA, and we’ll assume liability for that slice alone.” The documents back them up: “Administrative Information” is expressly defined to include only those items . Everything that lives in Snowflake or another warehouse stays outside the four corners of their DPA, and the CSA limits all liability (breach included) to what you paid in the prior 12 months.

How that lines up with your objectives

Data scope & protections. If Salve will never push regulated personal data into ThoughtSpot’s query tokens, their position is workable. But if even a tokenized string could expose PHI, GDPR special-category data, or California “sensitive personal information,” you’ll want to (a) broaden the DPA’s definition of Personal Data to cover any token or index that points back to such data, or (b) attach a short rider saying their ISO-27001 controls and breach-response duties apply to any data processed “in connection with” the service, not just to Administrative Information.

Liability & indemnity. Agreeing to a 3×-fees super-cap is real movement. On a \$45 k contract that still tops out at \$135 k—fine if you’re comfortable self-insuring above that, but low if you foresee reputational fallout from a mis-indexed dataset. Two levers:

1. Ask that the cap be the greater of 3× fees or $1 million. 2. Request evidence of cyber-E&O coverage at or above $5 million with Salve named as a certificate holder.

They still refuse breach indemnity, which is typical for “stateless” analytics vendors. I’d save negotiation capital for the dollar cap instead of chasing indemnity.

Suspension for non-payment. They won’t promise to keep the lights on if an invoice is late. A narrow fix usually flies:

“ThoughtSpot will not suspend the service while (i) Salve is disputing the relevant charges in good faith and (ii) all undisputed amounts are current.”

That protects you from innocent billing errors without giving a free ride to chronic non-payors.

Renewal pricing. They say they’ll “include language”—let’s draft it now: “Renewal fees shall not increase by more than the greater of five percent (5 😵 or CPI-U (U.S.) for the preceding 12-month period, and volume-tier pricing in Exhibit A will continue to apply.”

Service-level exit right. Their new clause lets you terminate after three SLA misses in any rolling six months and get a refund of prepaid fees. Two tweaks:

1. Tie the definition of “Service Level” to the numeric uptime in the Program Guide (99.5 % today) so they can’t move the goalposts. 2. Clarify that the refund is of unused prepaid fees (avoids prorating the current quarter twice).

Change-of-control / insolvency exit. The CSA is silent on voluntary exits. Add a simple buy-out option to the order form:
“Customer may terminate the subscription for convenience upon thirty (30) days’ written notice following (a) a Change of Control of Customer or (b) Customer’s entry into formal insolvency proceedings. ThoughtSpot shall promptly refund any prepaid, unused subscription fees.”
If they push back, you can offer a termination fee equal to 20 % of the remaining contract value as a compromise.

Next-step wording pack

1. Super-cap: “Notwithstanding Section 9.2 of the CSA, aggregate liability for a Security Incident shall not exceed the greater of (i) three (3) times the fees paid or payable under this Order Form, or (ii) \$1,000,000.” 2. Good-faith dispute carve-out for suspension (see above). 3. Renewal price guardrail (see above). 4. SLA exit – incorporate their paragraph with the two clarifications. 5. Change-of-control termination – language above.

Best, Sergei Tokmakov, Esq.

Hi Niki,

I've redrafted the referral agreement because your sample was too short and did not adequately address several critical legal and business issues that could expose us to significant risk. While your draft provided a good starting framework, it read more like an informal AI-generated summary than a legally binding contract that would hold up under scrutiny.

The primary issue with your version was the lack of proper legal structure and comprehensive risk mitigation. Your draft was missing essential definitional clarity. My redrafted agreement includes a detailed definitions section in Section 1 that precisely defines critical terms like Annual Contract Value (ACV), Customer, Qualified Lead, Contract Year, and Referral Period, which eliminates ambiguity about when payments are triggered and how they're calculated.

My Section 4 establishing the specific fee schedule in Section 4.1 with placeholder percentages to be filled in, detailed payment timing in Section 4.2 that clarifies fees are paid within thirty days after each contract year ends, and importantly, Section 4.3 introduces the warrant election option that gives referrers flexibility to take equity instead of cash. Section 4.4 even includes audit rights for referrers to verify payment accuracy, and Section 4.5 clearly delineates tax responsibilities.

The termination and renewal provisions in your draft were dangerously vague. My Section 5 establishes a proper three-year initial term with automatic one-year renewals, includes termination for convenience with thirty-day notice, termination for cause with specific breach cure periods, and crucially, Section 5.4 ensures referrers still get paid for contracts executed before termination. This protects both parties' interests and prevents disputes.

Section 9 includes comprehensive indemnification provisions protecting Salve from referrer misconduct, while Section 10 establishes liability limitations that cap our exposure. Section 7 provides robust confidentiality protections with specific exceptions and return obligations that your brief mention couldn't accomplish.

The referrer obligations in your draft were insufficient . My Section 6 establishes professional conduct standards, compliance with anti-bribery and healthcare regulations, prohibitions on misrepresentation, and importantly, a twelve-month non-solicitation period for our employees. Section 8 properly addresses intellectual property ownership and trademark usage rights with appropriate limitations.

The agreement I've drafted also includes proper legal formalities like Section 11 establishing independent contractor status, Section 12 governing assignment rights with appropriate exceptions for corporate transactions, and Section 14 covering miscellaneous provisions including electronic signature validity and proper notice procedures that your version overlooked entirely.

This redrafted agreement transforms your informal outline into a comprehensive legal document that protects our interests while maintaining fair terms for referral partners. The structure ensures enforceability while providing the clarity and specificity needed to prevent disputes and establish clear expectations for all parties involved.

Hi Sergei, thank you for your time putting this together. I do apologize for the confusion I never meant for our notes to be interpreted as a version. I wanted to understand the context of the inherent parts of a referral agreement so I initially asked AI for a questionnaire, my partner and I answered the questions and then to clean it up I ran it through again. Hopefully it was helpful, but future reference I don’t mean for our notes to be misconstrued as a version of the document, we absolutely need your services to write the agreement. It’s just helpful to have a frame a reference for documents we’ve never drafted before. It was a helpful exercise for us. We will read through this tomorrow and let you know if we have any questions.

Hi Sergei - separate request. We're getting an increased rate of requests to work with other customers and we'd like to offer PROSPECTIVE customers a preliminary audit type engagement where we do discovery and gather requirements to better understand their projects.

I have this SOW exhibit which is a part of our main MSA - I'd like to turn something like this into a standalone agreement where we can initiate a short-term (30/60/90 day) engagement to do discovery for that prospective customer. This is before we would design a whole SaaS/MSA for that customer.

Can I get your thoughts on how we could go about doing this?

Sergei Tokmakov
6:54 PM
Hi Niki,

This is a smart business development strategy. Converting your existing SOW structure into a standalone discovery agreement makes perfect sense for capturing prospects who aren't ready for a full MSA commitment but need to understand their requirements first.

Looking at your Story SOW, I can see the foundation is already there with the gap analysis, technology audit, and requirements gathering methodology. The key will be creating a flexible standalone agreement that protects your intellectual property while positioning you favorably for the larger engagement if they convert.

Here's how I'd approach structuring this:

We should create a "Technology Discovery and Assessment Agreement" that incorporates the core elements from Section 2 of your existing SOW but makes them modular for different engagement lengths. The 30-day version would focus primarily on the gap analysis and stakeholder interviews from Month 1 of your current SOW, while 60 and 90-day versions could include progressively more of the R&D and proof-of-concept work you're already doing successfully.

The agreement needs robust intellectual property protections since you'll be sharing your methodology and insights with prospects who may not convert. I'd include strong confidentiality provisions that go both ways, clear ownership language around any deliverables you create, and importantly, a conversion pathway that gives you favorable terms if they decide to proceed with a full engagement within a specified timeframe after the discovery period ends.

Payment structure should probably be front-loaded given the shorter timeframe and prospect nature of these engagements. Rather than monthly retainers, I'd recommend either full payment upfront or a significant portion due upon signing with the remainder at mid-point, along with clear scope limitations to prevent scope creep that could kill your margins on these shorter engagements.

We should also include termination provisions that protect you if they try to use your discovery work to engage a competitor, and conversion incentives that credit some portion of the discovery fee toward a full MSA if executed within 90 days of completion.

The success criteria and deliverables section from your existing SOW translates well, but we'd need to scale them appropriately for the shorter timeframes and ensure the deliverables are substantial enough to demonstrate value while not giving away everything they'd get in a full engagement.

I can draft this as a standalone agreement that references your standard terms where appropriate but functions independently of your MSA. We should also consider whether you want this to automatically convert prospects into your standard MSA pipeline or if you prefer a separate decision point.

Would you like me to start with a 60-day version as the baseline since that seems like the sweet spot for meaningful discovery without over-investing in prospects? We can always create shorter and longer variants once we have the core structure nailed down.

Let me know your thoughts on pricing structure and conversion incentives and I can get started on this.

Best, Sergei

Niki Rogers
9:29 PM
Your assessment is a work of art. I agree with everything you said. If we can move forward drafting it exactly as articulated I would be so thrilled. Down to the protections and the front loading of the receivables so we can just jump right into the work to be done. We have a unique situation right now where our technology is so agile and multi-purpose that several industries are interested in audits all at once and this discovery document is just the instrument we need to be able to pivot and do the discoveries without jeopardizing our IP or spinning our wheels getting to deep in any one direction. But if I have learned anything, you have to be extremely explicit about scope so you can get in and get out, or push them to create the larger engagement. Which is why I agree so much with your assessment, true brilliance.

We would love to proceed ASAP with the agreement drafting. Thank you so much for your time 🙏

A standalone agreement from the MSA is important, as we won’t have one.

60-days as a baseline is right for this agreement. It’s hard to do anything meaningful in 20 business days when you have to mobilize groups of people, so I think 60 days is a good start.

Payments we always do net 30 BUT the main deliverables aren’t released to the customer until payment is made in full. That’s our leverage to get the payment in.

Conversion incentives… I’ve never heard of this before, but I’m interested to learn more and how they can be useful. I don’t think I would apply credits to any future dev if that’s the idea behind them.

Let me know if I missed anything or if you have any follow up questions. 🙏

I’m generally a sponge though as well, so if you think there are best practices we should consider I’m always open ears.

Hi Niki,

Here's the agreement draft as discussed.

Your Requirements & Where They're Covered:

60-Day Baseline: Section 2 defines "Discovery Term" as 60 consecutive days, with detailed milestone schedule in Section 5.

Payment Structure (Net 30 + Deliverable Holdback): - Section 6.2: Net 30 payment terms as you prefer - Section 6.3: Final deliverables withheld until full payment (your leverage) - Section 6.2: Split into 60%/40% invoices (Day 1 and Day 30)

IP Protection: Section 7.2 ensures you retain your methodologies, know-how, and templates even after delivering work product to client.

Conversion Incentives: Section 12 provides for "agreed-upon percentage" credit toward future MSA if executed within 90 days (keeps it flexible rather than committing to specific percentages).

Scope Control: Section 3 has service boundaries, and "detailed task list and acceptance criteria" reference in Schedule A gives you explicit scope definition.

Competitor Protection: Section 14 includes 12-month non-solicitation, and Section 8 has strong confidentiality provisions lasting 5 years.

Get In/Get Out Structure: Section 13 allows termination for convenience with clear payment obligations, supporting your strategy to either convert or cleanly exit.

Please let me know what you think.

Best, Sergei

Hi Sergei

We didn't end up going with Thoughtspot for data/AI services. We have an alternative company, Omni, that we've chosen instead because it gives us a better, more scalable foundation to grow with. That being said, can I get your eyes on one more agreement?

Omni provided us with (1) Order Form and SLA (both attached), as well as Omni's Service Agreement linked below. Any red flags here? Anything we missed?

Omni Service Agreement: https://app.commonpaper.com/custom_term/5d64793b-aa20-4474-a036-1b40becf231d?agreement_id=3bab795d-a472-4b90-8ab9-2734ff66b663&token=0CxP0dOnPLISNBu2KDu_oJhX4zTt2dPOq0lsdH75418

Hi Niki,

Here are the key issues I spotted in the Omni package and the clauses I’d tighten before you sign:

1. Commercial exposure • Unlimited deploy-now / pay-later model. Omni lets you over-deploy client entities at no cost until 30 Jan 2026, then requires a semi-annual “true-up” starting 31 Jan 2026 with tiered surcharges ($250 → $25 per entity)﻿. If usage spikes, the retroactive bill could be material. Ask Omni to (a) cap any catch-up to forward-looking counts only, and (b) grant a discounted block of pre-paid entities to smooth budgeting. • Auto-renew + long tail. The Order Form shows Yes to auto-renew but the Standard Terms let the deal roll for successive 12-month terms unless you give notice before the contract’s “Non-Renewal Notice Date.” Nail down that window (e.g., 60 days) and insist on a written price-increase cap (CPI or 5 % max).   •. Date math looks off. Order lists a 12-month “Term” yet shows a 30 Jul 2027 end date. Clarify that the first two years are fixed-price and that renewal after July 2027 is expressly optional.

2. Service reliability & remedies: Uptime promise is 99.9 %. Acceptable, but credits are capped at one month of fees (and for quarterly invoices, an even lower 5 % cap) and are your exclusive remedy. Push for (i) credits that scale with impact and (ii) a right to terminate if uptime drops below target for any one month in a quarter—not two of three.   

3. Data, privacy & security • No PHI or other “Prohibited Data.” The Standard Terms forbid you from loading HIPAA-regulated data, bank-account numbers, etc., unless separately authorized. If Salve’s roadmap includes sensitive health metrics, you’ll need a BAA or carve-out here. • Machine-learning usage. Omni may aggregate your usage data to train its AI models. Data are de-identified, but confirm that (a) no customer content leaves the tenant boundary and (b) you get advance notice of any material changes.

4. Liability & indemnity • Caps and carve-outs. The Agreement caps damages at the “General Cap Amount” (default is usually 12 months of fees) and excludes consequential losses. Make sure the cap is at least the greater of 12 months’ fees or $500 k and that it does not apply to confidentiality, data-security, or IP infringement claims. • Provider indemnity is IP-only. Omni indemnifies you for third-party IP claims but not for data-security or privacy violations—yet your exposure to those risks is higher. Ask Omni to add a separate indemnity for breaches of its security obligations and for third-party privacy claims.

5. Suspension / termination • Omni can suspend service after 30 days’ non-payment; request a 10-day cure notice plus a commitment not to suspend for disputes you’ve properly noticed. • There is no termination for convenience. Negotiate a right to exit for any reason after the initial 12-month term with 60 days’ notice and a pro-rated refund of prepaid fees.

6. Other clean-ups • Refundability. Fees are non-refundable except in narrow cases—confirm you receive a pro-rated refund if Omni stops providing core functionality. • Logo rights. Omni may list Salve as a customer; add your written consent requirement for any press or logo use. • Data export. Upon termination Omni only deletes content within 60 days. Add an obligation to provide a full export in a commercially reasonable format before deletion. • Security program. Ask for confirmation of SOC 2 Type II (or ISO 27001) certification, encryption at rest/in-transit, and annual penetration testing—with a right to see the summary report.

You can send Omni a short issues list covering the points above and request a red-line of the Order Form and Standard Terms. Prioritize the economic and data-security items; most vendors will move on those if you frame them as standard.

Hi Sergei — your last review of our Omni agreement was spot on. They fulfilled almost all of your requests, so thank you. Omni has also provided a BAA and DPA as recommended to satisfy the PHI and HIPAA data policies. Could you take a look at these two agreements below? Everything should be available through the links, but let me know if you need anything else to complete your assessment. Appreciate your time as always.

Hi Niki,

I have reviewed the Omni DPA and BAA docs and prepared the attached analysis summarizing my findings.

Bottom line is that most of what we asked for in the last round made it in, but there are still a few screws that need a quarter-turn to get you the end-to-end privacy wrapper we targeted.

Key highlights:

- Good news: The 2-day PHI breach notice, 72-hour security incident clock, SOC 2 Type II commitments, and CCPA service-provider certification are all locked in - Fine-tuning needed: Five main areas including liability cap alignment (make sure it reflects our negotiated $500k super-cap), audit flexibility after breaches, longer sub-processor notice periods, PHI off-shoring restrictions, and automated data export on termination - BAA specifics: Need to address the Designated Record Set field, add PHI aggregation consent requirements, and mirror off-shore restrictions between both documents I’ve included a cut-and-paste issues list at the end that you can send directly to Omni if you want to move quickly.

Please let me know if you agree with any of the issues spotted and which ones you want me to redline, if any. We’re in the home stretch - with these tweaks you’ll have robust protection for your customers’ data while maintaining the operational flexibility you need.

Best, Sergei

Hi Sergei, I'm taking another look at this referral agreement. I have some comments highlighted in yellow - we would like to make the definition of ACV a bit more specific to be more of that ARR, and make sure there is language to exclude those payments that are not toward licensing or usage-based fees.

Also I would like to add some wording about being able to come up with a payment plan upon the end of a contract year, with the option of giving credits toward our services - since one of our largest referrals came from our flagship customer.

Please let me know if you need further clarification. Niki

Got it. Here are tight edits you can approve; once you’re happy, I’ll drop them in as redlines.

1) ACV = ARR (licensing/usage only). Replace §1.1 “ACV” with:

“Annual Contract Value (ACV) means the annualized value of recurring subscription and metered usage fees payable under a Customer Contract for the applicable Contract Year (i.e., the ARR attributable to that Customer for that period), excluding any amounts not attributable to licensing or usage, including one-time or non-recurring fees (e.g., implementation, onboarding, configuration, training, professional/managed services), hardware or equipment, pass-through or third-party costs, taxes, credits, refunds, chargebacks, and write-offs.”

(This keeps referral math tied to ARR and cleanly carves out services and other non-licensing amounts. )

2) Payment flexibility at year-end (installments and/or credits). Modify §4.2 (Payment Timing) to add the following sentences:

“Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon written notice to Referrer given no later than the payment due date, Salve may elect to satisfy any Referral Fee (in whole or in part) (a) in equal monthly installments over up to twelve (12) months following the end of the applicable Contract Year and/or (b) by issuing service credits valued dollar-for-dollar that are applicable to licensing or usage fees under one or more active Salve customer accounts designated by Salve. Any service credits will be non-transferable and may be applied at any time within twelve (12) months after issuance; any unused balance after such period will be paid in cash within thirty (30) days. If any installment becomes more than 30 days past due or upon Salve’s insolvency or change-of-control, any remaining unpaid Referral Fee amount becomes immediately due in cash.”

(That gives you room to pay over time or to grant credits to your flagship or other accounts, while preserving a cash backstop and acceleration on default. )

3) (Optional) Clean cross-reference in fee table. Add a parenthetical at the top of the §4.1 table: “(ACV calculated per §1.1)” to lock the exclusions to the payout grid. 

If these work, say the word and I’ll redline them into the working draft

Hey Sergei we had a call with the COO of Consumer Capital Management (the MSA I just sent you) and he laughed when he heard what the lawyers did to our agreement. Can I guide your assessment to return power to the Provider IP clause, give 90 days termination heads up, return negligence to the indemnity clause to prevent unlimited liability on us the Provider, and build in REASONABLE ownership wording where we can carve out what they actually walk away with if they leave Salve. Let me know if you need clarification. Thank you! Niki

Sergei Tokmakov
7:46 PM
Hi Niki -

Attached is the updated Referral Partner Agreement reflecting your notes. Quick summary of what changed:

• §1.1 (ACV = ARR). Rewrote the definition so ACV captures only recurring subscription + metered usage for the Contract Year, and expressly excludes services, hardware, pass-through/third-party costs, taxes, non-recurring credits, refunds/chargebacks, etc. Kept clear Included/Excluded bullets as illustrative, and added a precedence sentence so §1.1 controls over examples/tables. The fee table now cross-references §1.1. • §4.2 (Payment flexibility). Added Salve’s option to pay referral fees in up to 12 monthly installments and/or via dollar-for-dollar service credits usable on licensing/usage fees (12-month use window), with a cash backstop for any unused balance and acceleration if an installment is 30+ days late or on CoC/insolvency. • Fee tiering note. Clarified the tier adjustment if ACV grows into a higher band in later years. • Housekeeping. Hyphenated “first-in-time”, tightened survival pinpoint to §6(e), and cleaned minor formatting/spacing nits.

On your CCM MSA item: I’m on it next.

Niki -

Here’s a rebuttal + counter-language memo you can send back on the CCM MSA redlines. It restores Provider IP primacy, hardens indemnity (fault-based), adds 90-day convenience termination notice, and gives a reasonable exit carve-out for what CCM keeps - without exposing Salve’s platform, code, or methods.
CCM–Salve MSA redlines - IP:Work Product, Indemnity, Termination.docx 


CCM–Salve MSA redlines - IP:Work Product, Indemnity, Termination.docx
19 kB

Here are some talking points you can use on calls with the COO to frame this as standard SaaS risk-allocation (product vs. bespoke dev) and avoid scope creep:

How to frame it in 20 seconds We’re a multi-tenant SaaS, not a bespoke dev shop. The contract should reflect standard SaaS allocation of risk: Salve keeps platform IP; Customer keeps its data and gets practical continuity on exit; liability is tied to fault and capped; service quality is governed by SLAs and scoped work—not “work for hire.”

IP & “work product.” All platform assets—code, pipelines, DBT logic, schemas, templates, methods, and any enhancements—remain Salve’s Provider IP. Customer owns Customer Data and, once paid, the Customer-Specific Outputs we create that are severable from our IP (think report layouts they authored, field mappings they defined, static documentation). Where a deliverable unavoidably embeds Provider IP, Customer receives a perpetual, royalty-free, internal-use license—no source code, no reverse engineering, no disclosure, no derivatives. No “work-for-hire.” Keep a Residuals clause so generalized know-how in our unaided memory remains ours. If they want comfort, we can enumerate Customer-Specific Outputs in an SOW schedule.

Indemnity and liability. We’ll stand behind our product and our mistakes: Salve indemnifies for IP infringement by Provider IP as delivered/used per docs, and for gross negligence or willful misconduct. Carve-outs apply where Customer causes the risk (combinations, misuse, mods not by Salve, Customer Data, designs they dictate). Remedies are the industry trio— procure, replace/modify, and only if not feasible, credit/terminate the affected service. Customer indemnifies us for claims tied to Customer Data, Customer systems/integrations, misuse, or their negligence/willful misconduct. Overall liability is capped at 12 months of fees, with carve-outs only for IP indemnity, confidentiality breaches, and unpaid fees; no consequential/punitive/lost-profits. If they push, a higher cap can trade for multi-year or minimum-spend commitments.

Termination and exit. They can terminate for convenience on 90 days’ notice so both sides can plan a clean off-ramp. During the notice window and for 30 days post-term we provide read/export access, a commercially reasonable data export, and optional paid exit assistance at standard rates. On exit they keep (a) all Customer Data/exports; (b) any Customer-Specific Outputs we assigned; and (c) the narrow internal-use license to deliverables that unavoidably embed our IP—without any access to pipelines, DBT logic, or source.

SLAs and scope control. Uptime, response, and remedies live in the SLA; credits are the primary remedy, with refunds only where service can’t be reasonably provided. Support is not custom development; discrete deliverables live in SOWs, and changes use written change control. No code escrow or step-in rights; security/compliance are handled through confidentiality, reasonable safeguards, and audit logs—not code delivery.

Language that can’t live in the MSA. Anything labeling the engagement work made for hire; blanket assignments of “all Work Product including algorithms/software/specifications”; strict or uncapped indemnity; unlimited liability or carve-outs that swallow the cap; rights to access/inspect source/pipelines/DBT logic; or mandatory refunds that displace SLA credits.

Fallbacks (only if necessary). If they truly need ownership of specific artifacts, we can assign only those listed in an SOW, retain all background/derivative rights, and take a narrow license-back to generalized methods. If the cap is the sticking point, consider 1.5×–2× fees for a longer term or minimum spend. For confidentiality, we can add mutual injunctive relief and regulatory-compliance language— without any commitment to disclose code.

Close. “You keep the data and the practical deliverables you need to operate; we keep the platform so we can support you and every other customer. We accept responsibility for our IP and our fault, within a predictable cap. That’s how modern SaaS stays stable for both sides.”

Hi Sergei - thanks to your analysis, we were able to completely reject the previous version of the MSA that you reviewed. So thank you!

Their lawyer redid his redlines to reduce the changes substantially. I'm attaching the revised version below that I would like you to review for any lingering issues. If you can find ways to incorporate their requests without significantly increasing our liability, I am open to considering that.

Sidenote: We're very familiar with this customer, having worked with them for years. However, they've recently hired a new lawyer who isn't familiar with us. That said, we can push back reasonably where needed.

Thank you again so much, for your support! Niki

Hi Niki,

Great news on getting the prior version tossed. I reviewed the v2 set (SaaS, SLA, Data Warehouse SOW, Tech Assessment SOW, and the ULA). It’s much tighter. I’m good moving forward once we tidy a few blanks and lock a couple of commercial guardrails. None of this increases your liability; it mostly keeps the deal predictable and avoids scope drift.

1. Quick clean-ups • SLA timings have blanks. Set Sev-2 to “within eight (8) business hours” and Sev-3 to “within one (1) business day.” • Define “Normal Business Hours” (e.g., 9am–6pm Eastern, Mon–Fri, U.S. federal holidays excluded). • Fill the notice emails for both sides and fix the stray “Section \[•]” placeholders. • Confirm names/titles in the signature blocks.

2. Retainer vs. support hours The PO has a \$25k/month managed-services retainer and the SLA separately mentions “up to 10 hours” of Second Tier Support. To avoid double-billing, add a one-liner: “Included SLA hours are part of the monthly Managed Services retainer; time beyond that is billed at the agreed rates.”

3. Usage-based fees and transparency Align the fee table in Exhibit A with the C-1 SOW and add a light usage report and meter check so billing stays objective without being heavy-handed: “Provider will deliver a monthly usage report showing Event counts and fees. Customer may review supporting logs on reasonable notice once per quarter; if variance exceeds 3%, Provider credits the difference.” Also ask for a heads-up when they’re nearing a higher band: “Notify at 80% of any fee tier in a month.”

4. Suspension and bill disputes Keep your leverage but prevent a shutdown over a billing glitch: “No suspension while Customer is disputing the charges in good faith within 30 days of invoice and undisputed amounts are current. Ten (10) day cure after written notice before any suspension.”

5. Liability and indemnity Leave the cap at 12 months of fees. If they push, the only concession I’d make is a narrow one for IP claims: the cap doesn’t apply to defense costs and final judgments for IP infringement that we indemnify, and everything else stays under the cap.

6. SLA scope This SLA is response/resolve focused, which is fine. Clarify that “Resolve” includes a commercially reasonable workaround that materially mitigates the impact, and that any service credits are the exclusive remedy for SLA misses. That avoids arguments later without opening new remedies.

7. Paper order and ULA Set a clear hierarchy so the ULA can’t override the commercial deal: Agreement (including exhibits/SOWs) controls, then the SLA, then the ULA.

8. Assignment and change-of-control Give each side standard M\&A flexibility: assign to an affiliate or in a merger/asset sale so long as the assignee isn’t a direct competitor and assumes the obligations.

9. Territory and remote work The SLA defines “Territory” as the U.S. If any work occurs remotely outside the U.S., allow it while keeping data where the customer wants it: we can perform remotely from other locations so long as Customer Data is processed/stored in the designated region.

10. Data export and deletion On exit, provide a reasonable export on request and delete our copies within 30 days, except where the law requires retention. This matches what we promised commercially.

11. Scope control for C-1 and C-2 Add a simple change-order sentence so new asks don’t derail timelines: changes to scope, timelines, or deliverables require a signed change order, and we don’t start out-of-scope work until it’s signed.

12. Non-solicit Twelve months is fine as drafted.

If you’d like, I can drop these directly into a redline and send you a clean issues list for Joey. From a risk perspective the only true “red” item is the blank SLA timings and missing notice fields; everything else is straightforward and keeps the cap where it is.

Hi Sergei - how much of this is in response to their lawyer's redlines vs. general improvements of the agreement? I agree with much of what you're saying, but I don't want to introduce new agreement improvements at this stage unless necessary. My thoughts are, we can just do a 6-month agreement with them now (nothing of substance will be built before then - it's primarily consulting work right now), and then we can get them onto a new agreement come Q2 next year.

If we can respond directly to their redlines to prevent any major liability issues, we can make improvements to this agreement before their next version.

If possible, I would like you to make the redlines directly that are of the greatest importance.

I appreciate your time.

Sergei Tokmakov
5:45 PM
Hi Niki,

Most of my comments track directly to their lawyer’s v2 redlines; a handful are belt-and-suspenders improvements we can defer until the next paper.

Direct responses I can mark in tracked changes if you approve: • Fill the SLA blanks (Sev-2 at “within eight (8) business hours”; Sev-3 at “within one (1) business day”), define Normal Business Hours, complete notice emails, fix the stray cross-references, and confirm signature blocks. • Clarify that the “up to 10 hours” of Second Tier Support are included within the \$25k/month managed-services retainer so there is no double-billing; time beyond that bills at the agreed rates. • Add a narrow non-suspension clause for properly noticed, good-faith billing disputes and a 10-day cure before any suspension. • Keep the 12-month fees cap as drafted; if they press on IP risk, I’ll offer a tight carve limited to defense costs and final judgments on IP claims only, without moving the overall cap. • Set the order of precedence so the main Agreement and SOWs control, then the SLA, then the ULA, to prevent the ULA from overriding commercial terms. • Add a one-sentence change-order requirement in the C-1/C-2 SOWs so new asks don’t creep into scope or timelines without a signed CO.

Items we can defer to the next version: • Monthly usage report and a heads-up at 80% of a fee tier. • Clarifying “Resolve” to include a reasonable workaround and stating SLA credits are the exclusive remedy. • Standard assignment/change-of-control flexibility. • Territory/remote performance wording so work can be done remotely while data stays in the designated region. • A short export/deletion sentence on exit. • Non-solicit is fine as is.

On term length: I’m fine to shift this paper to a six-month term now given it’s mostly consulting. We don’t need to reopen economics to do that. I’ll keep the liability cap where it is to avoid re-trading unless you want me to try lowering it to “fees in the initial six-month term.

Please let me know if you agree with this. If you want me to widen or narrow that scope, say the word.

Niki Rogers
6:05 PM

Sergei Tokmakov
10:42 PM
Hi Niki,

Please take a look at my redlines implementing only the essential changes we discussed. Here's a summary of what I've completed:

SLA - Section 2.1(a): • Normal Business Hours and response timings were already correctly defined, so I left those unchanged • Added clarification that the "up to 10 hours" of Second Tier Support are included in the monthly retainer, not additional

SaaS Agreement - Section 2(f): Added non-suspension protection for good faith billing disputes (30-day dispute period, 10-day cure notice). Section 12(a): Established clear document hierarchy: Agreement/SOWs first, then SLA, then ULA

SOW C-1 Section 5 and SOW C-2 Section 5: Added change order requirements to prevent scope creep without signed authorization

All changes track directly to their lawyer's v2 redlines and address the critical gaps you identified. The liability cap stays at 12 months as negotiated.

/////

Dear [Counsel Name],

Thank you for the substantially revised MSA package. We've completed our review and are attaching the documents with final technical corrections to address the remaining administrative gaps.

Summary of Changes Made:

SLA Document - Section 2.1(a): - Clarified that the "up to 10 hours" of Second Tier Support are included within the monthly managed services retainer to avoid billing confusion

SaaS Agreement - Section 2(f): - Added standard protection against service suspension during good-faith billing disputes with appropriate cure periods

SaaS Agreement - Section 12(a): - Established clear document precedence order: Agreement (including SOWs) controls, then SLA, then ULA

SOW C-1 Section 5 and SOW C-2 Section 5: - Added change order provisions to manage scope changes effectively

We've maintained the liability framework as negotiated, including the 12-month cap. These are the straightforward technical items we discussed to complete the agreement. The revisions address administrative completions and prevent potential operational issues without reopening commercial terms.

Please review the attached redlined documents. We're ready to execute once these final technical points are confirmed.

Best regards,

Niki Rogers CEO Salve, Inc.

Hey Sergei, we are submitting an app to the apple store and would love to get your opinion on our privacy policy. This app is only for Salve customers and we don't track or sell any privacy data. And the only real data we're collecting is use and crash logs. Would love your take when you have a moment. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yRxIdHm-kzz3xuqVxBepfdkk2k04NXaUhnlEyvWvig4/edit?tab=t.0

Hi Tony,

Thanks for the heads-up and the draft. Big picture: this policy is close to what Apple wants for a B2B app and aligns with how you actually operate. It clearly states no tracking/selling, limits access to provisioned Salve customers, and already includes an App Store–style disclosure section. With a few targeted edits and filled blanks, you’ll be in good shape for App Review and enterprise customers.

Here’s my pass, itemized so you can adjust quickly:

1. There are “…” markers and bracketed ranges to finalize, especially in Data Retention and the service-provider list. Pick concrete windows (for example: usage and diagnostic logs 180 days; auth and security logs 12 months) and name the subprocessors you actually use today. If you use Sentry, leave it. If you use Crashlytics instead, swap it in and drop Sentry.

2. Lock the App Store disclosures to your actual Connect selections. Your “Data Linked to You” list (identifiers, contact info from registration, usage data, diagnostics) and “No tracking” statement are fine, but they must match the toggles you submit in App Store Connect. If IP address is captured for security/region inference, keep “general network information (IP, inferred region)” in the policy and ensure Connect reflects that under “Identifiers/Diagnostics.”

3. Children’s section. Add a short “not for children” clause: the app is a business tool not directed to individuals under 16 (or 13 if you prefer a U.S. COPPA frame), you don’t knowingly collect such data, and you’ll delete it if discovered. Apple looks for this.

4. Roles and ownership. You’re already close. Tighten the controller/processor split: for Customer Data in the customer tenant, Salve acts as processor/service provider to the customer; for app telemetry and operational security logs, Salve is the controller/business. State that clearly so enterprise reviewers don’t push back.

5. Service providers and data flows. Keep AWS for hosting and Sentry/Crashlytics for diagnostics if applicable. Add a one-liner that subprocessors are bound by contract to use data only to provide their services, and that you maintain a current list available on request. Optionally link to a public subprocessor page later.

6. Security specifics. A little more detail helps: encryption in transit and at rest, access controls with least privilege, audit logging, and vendor due diligence. Keep the “no system is perfectly secure” disclaimer.

7. Data retention. Pick specific durations. If some windows are configurable per customer contract, say that. Example: account data retained for the life of the customer relationship plus 90 days, then archived or deleted per contract; usage/diagnostic logs 180 days unless a longer window is required for security, support, or legal obligations.

8. User rights and how to exercise them. Keep it global and simple to avoid jurisdiction pages. Say users can request access, correction, deletion, or portability through their employer’s Salve administrator or by emailing (mailto:hello@getsalve.co), and you may route requests through the customer admin for verification. That satisfies GDPR-style expectations without overcommitting.

9 - “No sale or sharing” clarity for CPRA. You already say you don’t sell personal data and don’t use cross-context behavioral ads. Add one sentence that you also do not “share” personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising as those terms are defined under California law.

10. International transfers. If any EEA/UK data will be processed in the U.S., add that you use appropriate safeguards (e.g., the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK Addendum) with subprocessors as applicable. Short and generic is fine.

11: Non-tracking/ATT. You correctly say you don’t request Apple’s ATT permission. Add that you do not collect the IDFA and do not use third-party advertising SDKs.

12. Cookies and webviews. If the app uses embedded web content that sets cookies, add a sentence clarifying they’re functional only, no advertising cookies. If no cookies at all, say so.

13.. Linkability. Make sure this policy is hosted at a stable public URL (not behind a login) and that the in-app link points there. Apple will tap it during review.

If you want, I can turn these into a clean edit with final retention windows and a short children’s and transfers section. But if you implement the items above, your policy will be consistent with Apple’s review checklist and enterprise expectations without over-promising.

Send me the exact SDKs you’ve integrated (Sentry vs Crashlytics, analytics libraries if any), and confirm the retention windows you want to commit to, and I’ll lock the language accordingly.

Hey Sergei - we previously had your help on an MSA for Story Cannabis in October (thank you so much) - we have secured a new Purchase Order for January 1, so we'll need to roll the previous SOWs into a new Purchase Order under the same MSA. I'm almost done with the documents now - are you by chance available to review the new docs with a deliverable of Monday night / Tuesday delivery for that customer? My hope is that the changes aren't that substantial. I need your eyes on aligning the legalese. Below is what would be coming your way:

The SaaS Agreement will not be changing The SLA will have very subtle changes (I will redline for you) The SaaS will have a new Purchase Order form referencing the following SOWs:

1. Data Warehouse Services (which you previously reviewed) this one will have slight changes to pricing 2. iPaaS SOW - this one is new (manages the integrations/workflows we're implementing for the customer) 3. Managed Services / Project Management SOW - (this one is new, covers the consulting hours to implement the ipaas)

Please let me know, thank you for your time as always. Niki

Niki, yes, but please send them over as soon as you can so I can complete asap before the deadline.

Below is the newest and probably more complex document that covers our new iPaaS model - I'm sending this one now. I should have the rest of the docs done soon.

The SaaS and SLA cover the broader terms that will change little, if at all. For this iPaaS SOW it's moreso if an Integration goes down and prevents a Flow from working - it's like a force majeure event since we don't have control over third-party technologies we just have to wait for the tech to come back online. I want to make sure that's clear.

Besides this document I still have coming: SaaS (no changes) SLA (very slight changes to support procedures) Purchase Order (which will just reference the new SOW docs) --- Data Warehouse SOW (you previously reviewed this, we are just changing the pricing model) Managed Services SOW (to cover iPaas SOW PM)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Niki,

I know there is a tight deadline, so I went ahead and did a first-pass alignment review so we can keep this tight and get you a clean “no surprises” set for Story.

High-level: the structure is good (PO as the commercial wrapper, separate SOWs by workstream). Most of what I’m seeing is “alignment/legalese cleanup” rather than substantive re-trades. The biggest items to address are below.

1. Payment / invoicing consistency (must fix)

* The PO states invoices issue on the 1st of each month, Net 30, with interest. But the iPaaS SOW and PM SOW currently read like invoicing happens “upon completion of Services,” which doesn’t match (and doesn’t match a monthly retainer model). * Recommendation: conform C-5 and C-6 invoicing language to the PO (and clarify how setup fees are invoiced versus monthly recurring charges, and when MRC starts).

2. iPaaS SOW is missing IP & license substance (must fix): C-5 ends with the “INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & LICENSE” header but no actual terms under it. That’s an avoidable gap because it creates ambiguity about ownership of connectors/flows/work product. I’ll mirror the approach you used in the DW SOW (Provider owns work product / Customer gets the paid-up license) and make sure it dovetails with the SaaS Agreement’s IP section and the third-party connector reality.

3. Third-party integration downtime / “force majeure” concept (important; align with SLA)

* Your business point is right: outages/rate limits/API changes at Dutchie/Treez/etc. should not be treated as Salve’s platform downtime or an SLA breach. * Recommendation: in C-5 (and/or as an SLA carve-out), make explicit that third-party service unavailability, rate limiting, credential expiration, upstream schema/API changes, and third-party delays are excluded from availability commitments and service credits; Salve’s obligation is commercially reasonable efforts to monitor, alert, retry, and restore when the third party is back. Also tie this to timeline extensions / no liability for resulting delays.

4. Change management cross-reference is incomplete (clean-up). -- C-5 references a “Change Management process defined in Section ____” (blank section number). That needs to point to an actual process (either incorporate the CO process into C-5, or cross-reference C-6’s CO process if that’s intended).

5. Scope clarity: “Initial Flows” definition and where the actual list lives (important) --- C-5 says initial flows are “specifically detailed” in the integrations section (3.2.1), but 3.2.1 is the integrations list, not flows. That’s a scope-control issue. * Recommendation: either (a) include an explicit “Initial Flows” list (even high-level by department), or (b) make Exhibit D the controlling flow backlog, clearly incorporated and attached, with a precedence rule (e.g., Exhibit D governs priorities; CO required for new flows/integrations).

6. Exhibit D incorporation / precedence (important): C-5 relies heavily on “Exhibit D: 2026 Technical Roadmap spreadsheet” for deliverables and timelines. That’s fine, but only if it’s actually attached, incorporated by reference, and we state what happens if Exhibit D changes (CO required) and what controls in a conflict (SaaS Agreement > PO > SOW > Exhibit D, or whatever hierarchy you want).

7. Pricing mechanics in C-5 (important). Integration-based pricing is clear, but we should tighten a few mechanics: a) When the one-time setup fees are invoiced (at kickoff vs on go-live vs milestone). b) When the monthly fee starts for each integration (PO effective date vs first production flow live for that integration), and proration for partial months. c) Define included event volume (right now it reads like an example) and specify overages / throttling / rate-limit handling so you’re not implicitly committing to “infinite throughput” at a fixed price.

8. PM SOW alignment (important)

* C-6 pricing table is a monthly retainer with monthly hours, but the payment language doesn’t match that reality. Same fix as #1. * Also, C-5 says PM is governed by C-6. We should confirm there’s no duplication (i.e., C-5 shouldn’t imply PM deliverables are included in the integration fees if C-6 is separately charging).

9. Deliverable holdback / suspension (good; just align terms): The holdback concept is good across the docs; I’ll just make sure the trigger language and “what can be withheld” is consistent with the PO/SaaS Agreement (services vs deliverables vs access).

10. Minor drafting consistency / defined terms

* Make sure “SOW Effective Date” vs “Effective Date” isn’t duplicative/conflicting, and that “Engagement Term” references the PO consistently across all SOWs. * Confirm the “any other C-5 SOW” phrasing is intentional (likely meant “any other SOW”).

Next item I still need from you to finalize the full alignment pass: the SLA redline when ready. A few of the third-party outage positions and support-channel mechanics should land there (or be expressly carved out there) so Story can’t argue “integration outage = SLA breach.”

You are the MAN. I'm responding in a word doc for easy tracking with your feedback. Let me know if you have any more questions, I'm infinitely available to support you.

To clarify, please go ahead and make the recommended changes, taking my feedback into account from the attached document.

I will have the SLA over to you shortly. Niki

Here is the SLA with tracked changes. You can see there isn't much that I changed - probably the most substantial being that we are introducing AI agent support in-app, with a cap of 250 support calls per month allocated to Power Users by permission only. I call them Power Users because entry-level staff might abuse this tool, and it can become rather pricey. If it's effective, we may end up upping their usage, but this is a test case scenario atm.

I welcome your edits/additions based on your review of the first round of documents.

Hi Niki — I’ve completed the redlines for the four documents.



For better organization/presentation of these redlines across multiple files, I put everything into a secure workroom with my annotations:



https://terms.law/TermsDocs/secure-ax7k9m2/
Password: Story2026



Inside the workroom:
• Each doc has its own card with (i) What Changed + (ii) Why These Matter, matched to the corresponding redlined Word file for traditional Track Changes review.
• There’s also an internal negotiation playbook (Must / Prefer / Fallback + “what to say”) so you can handle pushback efficiently.

Sergei Tokmakov just had a call with the customer - they want to put in a contingency if the project is late, delayed, etc. - I mentioned our Change Order clause but they seem to want their lawyers to come up with a contingency. Do you have any thoughts that I could seed to that conversation that would be above and beyond the CO clause?

Sergei Tokmakov
1:57 PM
Hi Niki — yes, we can give them a “delay contingency” framework that complements the CO clause, but I’d steer away from LDs/penalties. A clean structure that usually satisfies counsel is:



1. Baseline Plan + Rebaseline Mechanism. Attach a milestone plan (or “Project Plan”) as an exhibit, and include a rebaseline process: if assumptions change (scope, access, approvals), we update dates via written change log / CO.
2. Delay Classification (Excused vs. Provider-Caused).
• Excused delays = Customer delays (approvals, data access, SMEs), third-party outages/API changes, dependency vendors, and any CO-driven scope increases → dates extend day-for-day.
• Provider-caused delay = Salve misses a milestone on the critical path for reasons within Salve’s control, after timely Customer cooperation.
3. Notice + Mitigation + Escalation. Require prompt written notice of schedule risk; then a short escalation path (PPOCs → exec sponsor) and a mitigation plan (re-sequence tasks, add resources if agreed, narrow scope, etc.).
4. Contingency / Remedy (capped). If there’s a Provider-caused delay beyond a defined grace period (e.g., 10 business days) for a defined milestone, Customer gets a limited service credit or fee abatement, capped (e.g., 5–10% of the affected month / milestone fee; aggregate cap 1 month of fees). Make it the exclusive remedy for schedule delay.
5. Termination Right for Chronic Delay (with refund of unused prepaid fees). If Provider misses X milestones or is delayed Y days on the critical path due to Provider-caused reasons, Customer may terminate and receive a refund of prepaid, unused fees for the remaining period (again, exclusive remedy).
6. No penalties / no consequential damages. Explicitly: no liquidated damages, no lost profits, no “business interruption” claims for delay; everything still sits under the LOI cap.



If Story wants something tangible, the “credit/abatement + termination trigger” usually scratches the itch while keeping the risk bounded and aligned to actual fees.



If you want, I can draft a short “Schedule Contingency” clause + exhibit language they can drop into the SOW/SLA.

Niki Rogers

Hi Sergei,



Tony and I very much agree with your approach. Our core belief is that Step #3 must provide a clear opportunity to rectify any delay or issue because it’s inevitable, given the complexity of coordinating with 11 Integration partners and 6 internal departments.



We propose that a financial penalty should not be applied, provided that we are actively, to your point:



* Giving notice / escalating to the proper parties
* Acknowledging the specific risk
* Communicating clear workarounds
* Actively working to mitigate the risk
* Making demonstrable effort to complete the outstanding work



Again, given the complexity of the project, we feel it's fair that credits and the right to terminate should only become applicable if we are unable to rectify the delay within 30 days of it being identified in Step 3.



But to ensure these terms are reciprocal and fair, the reverse must also be true. If the customer is the cause of a project delay that exceeds 30 days, we must have the right to charge additional managed services fees for the extra time. *As we experienced with an RFP response timeline previously on a technical audit with this customer, their own delays prolonged the project timeline by 30 days while the contracted scope remained the same. This reciprocal term protects our team's resources and ensures appropriate compensation for a prolonged engagement.



And if we can get away with #6 I'm all for it. But you're free to draft this - I think I'd like to get ahead of them on this otherwise we will be going back and forth with their lawyers. I believe this approach to be reasonable and fair for all parties.



Thank you!
Niki
