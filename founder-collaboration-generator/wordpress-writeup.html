    <p>Starting a business with co-founders is exciting, but without clear legal boundaries, your vision can quickly turn into a dispute. A founder collaboration agreement (sometimes called a founder's agreement or pre-incorporation agreement) establishes the ground rules <em>before</em> you formally incorporate your business.</p>

    <h2 class="fca-section-title">Key Risk Areas to Address</h2>
    <p>The most successful founder relationships start with addressing potential issues upfront. Here are the critical risk areas the agreement covers, color-coded by potential impact:</p>
    
    <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      <div class="fca-card fca-risk-high">
        <div class="fca-card-header">Equity Allocation</div>
        <div class="fca-card-body">
          <p><strong>High Risk:</strong> Improper equity allocation is the #1 source of founder disputes. The agreement must clearly define initial ownership percentages that total exactly 100%.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fca-card-footer">
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Consider contributions beyond just time - expertise, capital, and existing assets all factor into fair equity splits.
        </div>
      </div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      <div class="fca-card fca-risk-high">
        <div class="fca-card-header">Intellectual Property Assignment</div>
        <div class="fca-card-body">
          <p><strong>High Risk:</strong> Without proper IP assignment, founders might claim ownership of critical business assets if they leave. This can devastate fundraising efforts and valuation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fca-card-footer">
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Clearly identify any pre-existing IP a founder is bringing to the venture but not transferring.

        <div class="fca-card-header">Vesting Schedules</div>
        <div class="fca-card-body">
          <p><strong>High Risk:</strong> Without vesting, a founder could leave after a month but keep their full equity stake. Industry-standard 4-year vesting with a 1-year cliff protects all parties.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="fca-faq">
      <div class="fca-faq-item">
        <div class="fca-faq-question">When is the right time to create a founder collaboration agreement?</div>
        <div class="fca-faq-answer">
          <p>The best time is as early as possible - ideally before significant work has been done on the project. The second best time is now. Many co-founders start collaborating informally, but once you're committed to building something together, formalizing the relationship protects everyone involved. Don't wait until conflict arises to establish ground rules.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="fca-faq-item">
        <div class="fca-faq-question">How is this different from incorporation documents?</div>
        <div class="fca-faq-answer">
          <p>A founder collaboration agreement governs your relationship before formal incorporation. It's a bridge document that establishes equity splits, roles, IP ownership, and other essential elements while you're still developing your concept. When you formally incorporate (typically as an LLC or C-Corporation), you'll create official corporate documents like bylaws, operating agreements, and stock purchase agreements. The terms in your founder collaboration agreement will help guide those formal documents.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="fca-faq-item">
        <div class="fca-faq-question">How do we determine fair equity splits?</div>
        <div class="fca-faq-answer">
          <p>Equity splits should reflect both past contributions and expected future contributions. Consider factors like: idea origination, technical expertise, industry connections, capital contributions, full-time commitment, opportunity cost, and risk taken. Equal splits (50/50) are common for two founders who are both fully committed, but don't default to equal splits without discussion. A dynamic split calculator or "equity pie" discussion is often valuable for teams of 3+ founders. Remember that equity without vesting is dangerous - a founder who leaves early should not retain their full stake.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="fca-faq-item">
        <div class="fca-faq-question">Why is vesting so important in a founder agreement?</div>
        <div class="fca-faq-answer">
          <p>Vesting is crucial because it aligns incentives and protects committed founders. Without vesting, a founder could leave after a short period but retain their full equity stake - creating a "dead equity" problem that can cripple future funding rounds and demotivate remaining founders. The standard 4-year vesting schedule with a 1-year cliff means that founders earn their equity over time, demonstrating sustained commitment. After one year, 25% of equity vests (the "cliff"), and the remaining 75% vests monthly over the following three years. If a founder leaves before the cliff, they typically retain no equity.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="fca-faq-item">
        <div class="fca-faq-question">What happens to this agreement after we incorporate?</div>
        <div class="fca-faq-answer">
          <p>When you formally incorporate, the provisions of your founder collaboration agreement will generally be superseded by your formal corporate documents. However, the original agreement remains valuable as evidence of your original intent regarding equity splits, roles, and IP assignment. Some provisions, particularly around IP assignment for work done before incorporation, will continue to be relevant. When you incorporate, you'll want to ensure that all IP is properly transferred to the new entity, and that equity allocations match what was agreed upon in your founder collaboration agreement (subject to any adjustments due to vesting or departures).</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="fca-faq-item">
        <div class="fca-faq-question">Are non-compete provisions enforceable?</div>
        <div class="fca-faq-answer">
          <p>Non-compete enforceability varies significantly by jurisdiction. In California, for example, non-compete provisions are generally unenforceable except in very limited circumstances like the sale of a business. Other states enforce reasonable non-competes, typically those limited in geographic scope, duration (usually 1-2 years maximum), and scope of prohibited activities. If you include non-compete provisions, make them as narrowly tailored as possible. Non-solicitation provisions (preventing founders from poaching customers or employees) are generally more enforceable across jurisdictions than broad competitive restrictions.</p>
