<p>Issuing stock is an important step for any company and it is crucial to comply with federal and state securities laws and regulations. There are two types of securities offerings under U.S. law: public offerings and private offerings. Public offerings are registered with the relevant authorities and once registered, the securities can be publicly traded or transferred, unless deregistered by regulators. In contrast, private offerings are generally prohibited from general solicitation of investors or advertising and the securities are “restricted”, meaning they may not be resold or transferred without registration or an exemption from registration.</p>



<p>A common mistake made by company founders and even legal counsel is neglecting to consider the applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations. While some states have exemptions for initial issuances of stock to founders in connection with the formation of a corporation, these exemptions are limited and do not apply to future investors. In addition, some states have self-executing exemptions from registration, while others require filings, notices, and filing fees.</p>



<p>When evaluating any offers and sales of securities, it is important to check both state and federal laws and regulations to determine the required compliance, including any private offering exemptions. Due to the cost and length of regulatory review of public securities offerings, companies typically opt for a private securities offering exemption. However, it is crucial to work with legal counsel to properly plan, conduct, and manage securities offerings, as an illegal offering can result in criminal and civil liability, with the most common remedy being rescission of the entire offering.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The most frequently used federal private offering safe harbor in securities sales is Rule 506(b) under Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933. This rule accounts for over 85% of the total amount raised through private securities sales. Companies typically only sell to &#8220;accredited investors&#8221; under this rule, who are defined as individuals with either an annual income exceeding $200,000 (or $300,000 with a spouse) for the past two years and a reasonable expectation of the same for the current year, or a net worth of over $1 million (excluding the primary residence). Entities such as banks, partnerships, corporations, nonprofits, and trusts may also be accredited investors.</p>



<p>Rule 506(b) provides a &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; for companies under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. To use this exemption, companies must follow certain requirements, such as not using general solicitation or advertising to market the securities, and selling to an unlimited number of accredited investors and up to 35 other purchasers who must be considered sophisticated. Companies must provide accurate and complete information to all investors, including non-accredited investors, and must be available to answer any questions.</p>



<p>In addition to Rule 506(b), Regulation D also contains private securities offerings exemptions under Rule 504 ($5 million dollar raise cap for 12 months) and Rule 506(c) (not widely used).</p>



<p></p>



<p>Rule 506(b), allows companies to sell securities to an unlimited number of accredited investors, who must meet specific income or net worth criteria, and up to 35 other purchasers who are considered sophisticated. The company cannot use general solicitation or advertising, and any information provided to investors must be free from false or misleading statements.</p>



<p>Under Rule 506(c), companies can solicit and advertise their offering as long as they only sell to accredited investors and take reasonable steps to verify their accreditation. Both Rule 506(b) and (c) offerings are considered restricted securities, meaning they cannot be sold for a certain period without registering them with the SEC. Companies must file a Form D with the SEC after their first sale, which provides limited information about the company and its offering.</p>



<p>It is important to also check with your state regulator to see if they have received notice of the offering for sale in your state. The North American Securities Administrators Association can provide contact information for your state securities regulator.</p>

<li>Representations and Warranties of the Purchaser. The Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to the Company that:</li>
</ol>



<p>3.1. Authorization. The Purchaser has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement. This Agreement, when executed and delivered by the Purchaser, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Purchaser, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and any other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, and as limited by laws relating to the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.</p>

By executing this Agreement, the Purchaser further</p>



<p>represents that the Purchaser does not presently have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any Person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such Person or to any third Person, with respect to any of the Shares. The Purchaser has not been formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the Shares.</p>

The Purchaser acknowledges that the Company has no obligation to register or qualify the Shares for resale. The Purchaser further acknowledges that if an exemption from registration or qualification is available, it may be conditioned on various requirements including, but not limited to, the time and manner of sale, the holding period for the Shares, and on requirements relating to the Company which are outside of the Purchaser’s control, and which the Company is under no obligation and may not be able to satisfy.</p>



<p>3.6. Legends. The Purchaser understands that the Shares and any securities issued in respect of or exchange for the Shares, may be notated with one or all of the following legend:</p>



<p>“THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AND HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION THEREOF. NO SUCH TRANSFER MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN A FORM SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE<br>SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.”</p>
