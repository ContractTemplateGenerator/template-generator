<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Introduction"></span>Introduction<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration has recently launched a series of new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/05/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-new-steps-to-advance-responsible-artificial-intelligence-research-development-and-deployment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initiatives</a> aimed at promoting the research, development, and deployment of responsible artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States. As AI technologies, such as OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT, become more prominent, these efforts prioritize the protection of individuals&#8217; rights and safety. The Administration is placing an emphasis on the well-being of the general public, while also addressing potential risks to society, security, and the economy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Key_Initiatives"></span>Key Initiatives<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The new initiatives include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Establishment of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and related executive actions:</strong> This provides a guiding framework for AI development and usage, focusing on the rights of individuals and the ethical implications of AI.</li>



<li><strong>Implementation of the AI Risk Management Framework:</strong> This framework is designed to assess and manage potential risks associated with AI technology.</li>



<li><strong>Development of a roadmap for the establishment of a National AI Research Resource:</strong> This roadmap outlines plans for a dedicated resource to bolster AI research at a national level.</li>



<li><strong>Investments and actions to address national security concerns related to AI:</strong> Recognizing the potential implications of AI for national security, the Administration is taking steps to address these concerns.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="National_AI_R_D_Strategic_Plan"></span>National AI R&amp;D Strategic Plan<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) at the White House has unveiled an updated version of the National AI R&amp;D Strategic Plan. The plan outlines the key priorities and objectives for federal investments in AI research and development. It reflects the federal government&#8217;s commitment to investing in research and development that encourages responsible innovation in the US.</p>



<p>The plan was formulated by experts from various federal government agencies and incorporates public input. In line with the Administration&#8217;s commitment to inclusivity and collaboration, the OSTP has issued a Request for Information (RFI) to seek public input on national priorities pertaining to mitigating AI risks. This RFI is part of the Administration&#8217;s ongoing efforts to develop a comprehensive strategy for managing AI risks and maximizing AI opportunities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="AI_and_the_Future_of_Teaching_and_Learning"></span>AI and the Future of Teaching and Learning<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The US Department of Education&#8217;s Office of Educational Technology has released a report titled &#8220;Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Future of Teaching and Learning: Insights and Recommendations&#8221;. The report offers an overview of the risks and opportunities that arise from the application of AI in different educational areas, including teaching, learning, research, and assessment.</p>



<p>The report acknowledges the potential advantages of AI in education, such as facilitating novel modes of engagement between educators and students, contributing to mitigating learning disparities, enhancing feedback mechanisms, and offering support to educators. However, it also underscores the associated risks linked to AI, particularly concerning algorithmic bias, and emphasizes the critical importance of trust, safety, and the implementation of suitable protective measures.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Listening_Session_on_Automated_Technologies"></span>Listening Session on Automated Technologies<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>In a move to understand the impact of AI on the workforce, the White House is organizing a listening session to collect insights from workers regarding the use of automated technologies by employers for purposes such as surveillance, monitoring, evaluation, and management. The session will involve the participation of policy experts, researchers, and policymakers from a wide range of sectors, including call centers, trucking, warehousing, healthcare, and gig work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration&#8217;s new initiatives demonstrate a proactive approach towards managing the challenges and harnessing the opportunities presented by AI.
