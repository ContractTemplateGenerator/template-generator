      <h1>Identifying Partnership Issues for New Businesses: Navigating the Business Marriage</h1>
      <div class="meta">Published: May 31, 2023 • M&amp;A</div>
      <div class="content">
<p>Starting a business with a partner can be a great way to combine strengths, resources, and ideas. But just like any marriage, a partnership can also come with its own set of challenges and issues. It&#8217;s important to be aware of these potential roadblocks and know how to address them before they escalate into bigger problems.</p>



<p>Legally, a partnership has five elements: (1) There must be an agreement; (2) between two or more persons; (3) who agree to carry on a business; (4) with the object of sharing profits; and (5) the business must be carried on by all or any of them acting for all. Think of a partnership as a “business marriage” &#8211; it requires a commitment from both parties to work together towards a common goal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Types_of_Partnerships"></span>Types of Partnerships <span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Here are some of the most common partnership structures:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>General Partnership (GP): A GP is a simple type of partnership in which all partners have unlimited personal liability for the partnership&#8217;s debts and obligations.</li>



<li>Limited Partnership (LP): An LP is a type of partnership that has one or more general partners who have unlimited personal liability and one or more limited partners who only have limited liability.</li>



<li>Limited Liability Partnership (LLP): An LLP is a type of partnership in which all partners have limited liability for the partnership&#8217;s debts and obligations.</li>



<li>Limited Liability Limited Partnership (LLLP): An LLLP is a type of partnership that combines the features of a limited partnership and a limited liability partnership.</li>



<li>Limited Liability Company (LLC): An LLC is a hybrid business structure that provides the personal liability protection of a corporation and the tax benefits of a partnership.</li>



<li>Corporation (usually S-Corp): A corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners, which means that the owners have limited liability for the corporation&#8217;s debts and obligations.</li>



<li>Strategic Partnership: A strategic partnership is a type of partnership in which two or more companies collaborate to achieve a common goal or to achieve mutual benefits.</li>



<li>Joint Venture: A joint venture is a type of partnership in which two or more companies come together to undertake a specific project or to start a new business.</li>
</ol>



<p>It&#8217;s important to choose the right partnership structure for your business based on your goals, resources, and the legal and tax requirements of your jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Partnerships can be a great way to grow your business, but not all partnerships are created equal. To increase your chances of success, it&#8217;s important to consider the following elements of a successful partnership:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Trust: Trust is the foundation of any partnership. Partners need to trust each other to work together effectively.</li>



<li>Communication: Good communication is essential in a partnership. Partners should be open, honest, and direct in their communication to avoid misunderstandings and resolve conflicts quickly.</li>



<li>Proper Business Planning: A well-thought-out business plan is essential for a successful partnership. This includes upfront knowledge of costs and target market, as well as a strong understanding of each partner&#8217;s exit strategy.</li>



<li>Clarity of Purpose and Responsibilities: Partners should have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities in the partnership. This helps to ensure that everyone is working towards the same goal.</li>



<li>Expectations Management: Managing expectations is key to a successful partnership. Partners should have a clear understanding of what each expects from the partnership and what the partnership can realistically achieve.</li>



<li>Profitability Is Not the Only Indicator of Success: Just because a partnership is profitable doesn&#8217;t mean it is successful. A successful partnership involves much more than just making money.</li>



<li>Equality of Effort Is Not Required: Partners don&#8217;t have to contribute equally in terms of effort or resources to the partnership. What&#8217;s important is that each partner is fulfilling their responsibilities and contributing to the partnership&#8217;s success.</li>
</ol>



<p>By considering these elements of a successful partnership, you can increase your chances of forming a partnership that is long-lasting and fulfilling.</p>



<p>With this in mind, let&#8217;s explore some of the common partnership issues that new businesses may face:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Unequal Contributions: One partner may feel like they are doing more work or contributing more to the business than the other. This can lead to feelings of resentment and a breakdown in the partnership.</li>



<li>Differences in Vision: Partners may have different ideas about the direction and goals of the business, leading to disagreements and conflict.</li>



<li>Lack of Communication: Partners may not be communicating effectively, leading to misunderstandings and missed opportunities.</li>



<li>Financial Mismanagement: Partners may not be on the same page when it comes to financial decisions, leading to disagreements and potentially putting the business at risk.</li>



<li>Personal Issues: Personal issues, such as stress or health problems, can impact a partner&#8217;s ability to contribute to the business and cause strain on the partnership.</li>
</ol>



<p>It&#8217;s important for partners to have open and honest communication about these potential issues before they arise. It&#8217;s also a good idea to have a written agreement in place that outlines each partner&#8217;s responsibilities and expectations, and a plan for resolving conflicts if they arise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Exit_Strategies"></span>Exit Strategies<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>One of the most important elements of a successful partnership is having a clear understanding of each partner&#8217;s exit strategy. This is the plan for how each partner will eventually leave the partnership, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The following are some common exit strategies:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Passing on to the Next Generation: This exit strategy involves passing the ownership and management of the partnership to the next generation of family members.</li>



<li>Sale to Another Partner: In this exit strategy, one partner sells their share of the partnership to another partner, usually after a triggering event, such as reaching a certain revenue or after a certain amount of time has passed.</li>



<li>Sale to Private Equity: In this exit strategy, the partnership is sold to a private equity firm.</li>



<li>Sale to a Competitor: In this exit strategy, the partnership is sold to a competitor in the same industry.</li>



<li>Initial Public Offering (IPO): An IPO is the process of taking a company public and offering its shares to the general public. This exit strategy can be used by a partnership to raise capital and provide liquidity for its partners.</li>
</ol>



<p>It&#8217;s important for each partner to be upfront about their exit strategy and for the partnership agreement to reflect these strategies. This helps to ensure that the partnership is structured in a way that supports each partner&#8217;s goals and reduces the likelihood of conflict or misunderstandings in the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Establishing_a_Successful_Partnership_Steps_to_Follow"></span>Establishing a Successful Partnership: Steps to Follow<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Starting a partnership can be a complex and challenging process, but with the right preparation and approach, you can increase the chances of success. Here are five steps to follow:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do Your Due Diligence: Before entering into a partnership, it&#8217;s important to do your due diligence on the potential partner(s). This includes reviewing their business history, financials, and reputation.</li>



<li>Obtain the Intentions of Each Partner: To avoid misunderstandings and conflicts, it&#8217;s important to obtain the intentions of each partner before entering into a partnership. This can be done through a partnership questionnaire, which should cover each partner&#8217;s goals, expectations, and desired outcomes.</li>



<li>Obtain Consensus on Conflict Points: Before entering into a partnership, it&#8217;s important to identify and resolve any potential conflict points. This requires open and honest communication between the partners and a willingness to find mutually acceptable solutions.</li>



<li>Draft and Negotiate the Partnership Agreement: Once you have identified the intentions of each partner and resolved any conflict points, it&#8217;s time to draft and negotiate the partnership agreement. This agreement should clearly outline the terms of the partnership, including the division of responsibilities, profits, and any exit strategies.</li>



<li>Execution: The final step is to execute the partnership agreement, which typically involves signing the agreement and putting it into effect. It&#8217;s important to monitor the partnership regularly and make any necessary changes to the agreement over time to ensure its continued success.</li>
</ol>
