<p>Every company needs a well-drafted consulting agreement. However, many companies use generic agreements that are not suited to their specific needs. A consulting agreement refers to an independent contractor agreement.</p>



<p>Essential elements in a consulting agreement include:</p>



<p>• Detailed description of the consultant&#8217;s duties, with a catch-all provision that includes &#8220;related duties assigned by the company within the scope of this agreement&#8221;. </p>



<p>• Exit clause &#8211; in case the company needs to end the agreement before its expiration, it should be &#8220;with or without cause.&#8221; </p>



<p>• No severance pay or termination fees. </p>



<p>• No stock or equity for the consultant, as they should not become shareholders and have access to financials or voting rights. </p>



<p>• Confidentiality and non-solicitation clauses. </p>



<p>• Dispute resolution through arbitration, which favors the company and avoids public lawsuits. </p>



<p>• Protection of company IP, and a statement of prior ownership and assignment of IP developed during the engagement. </p>



<p>• Consultant is solely responsible for their income taxes and tax filings.</p>



<p>Non-compete clauses are often not included in consulting agreements, as independent contractors do not owe the same fiduciary duties as employees, and non-competes may limit a consultant&#8217;s potential clients.</p>
