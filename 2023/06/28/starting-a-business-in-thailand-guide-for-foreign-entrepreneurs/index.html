<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Introduction"></span>Introduction<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Thailand, known as the Land of Smiles, offers a wealth of opportunities for foreign entrepreneurs. The country&#8217;s strategic location at the heart of Asia, coupled with its robust economy and large consumer market, make it an attractive destination for business ventures. However, starting a business in Thailand as a foreigner is not without its challenges. Navigating the legal landscape can be complex, and understanding the nuances of the country&#8217;s business laws is crucial for success.</p>



<p>One of the most important pieces of legislation that foreign entrepreneurs need to understand is the Foreign Business Act (FBA). This law governs the types of businesses that foreigners can engage in, the percentage of ownership they can hold, and the processes they need to follow to legally operate in Thailand. Other relevant laws include the Civil and Commercial Code, which covers matters related to company registration and operation, and the Labor Protection Act, which outlines the rights and duties of employers and employees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Understanding_the_Foreign_Business_Act"></span>Understanding the Foreign Business Act<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The Foreign Business Act (FBA) is a central piece of legislation that any foreign entrepreneur looking to start a business in Thailand must understand. Enacted in 1999, the FBA was designed to regulate foreign businesses and protect domestic industries. It defines who is considered a foreigner, outlines the types of businesses that foreigners can and cannot engage in, and stipulates the requirements for obtaining a Foreign Business License.</p>



<p>The FBA categorizes businesses into three lists, each with its own set of restrictions for foreign ownership:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>List One</strong> includes businesses that are absolutely prohibited to foreigners for special reasons. These are businesses that affect national security, art, culture, tradition, and natural resource conservation. Examples include newspaper publishing, radio broadcasting, and farming.</li>



<li><strong>List Two</strong> comprises businesses related to national safety or those that could have an impact on arts, culture, and traditional customs. Foreigners can engage in these businesses only with the permission of the Minister with the approval of the Cabinet. Examples include production of firearms, trading in antique or art objects, and production of sugar from sugarcane.</li>



<li><strong>List Three</strong> includes businesses in which Thai nationals are not yet ready to compete with foreigners. Foreigners wishing to engage in these businesses must obtain a Foreign Business License. Examples include retailing of all categories of goods, wholesaling of all categories of goods, and service businesses.</li>
</ol>



<p>Understanding these lists is crucial for foreign entrepreneurs as they determine the type of business they can engage in and the level of ownership they can hold. It&#8217;s also important to note that the FBA allows for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as when a treaty or specific act provides for an exemption. Therefore, foreign entrepreneurs should not be deterred by the restrictions but should instead seek professional advice to understand how they can navigate the FBA and successfully start their business in Thailand.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Opportunities_in_Permitted_Businesses"></span>Opportunities in Permitted Businesses<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Thailand&#8217;s vibrant economy, strategic location, and business-friendly policies make it an attractive destination for foreign investors. Despite the restrictions outlined in the Foreign Business Act, there are numerous sectors where foreign businesses can thrive. Let&#8217;s explore some of these promising sectors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="ImportExport"></span>Import/Export<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Thailand&#8217;s strategic location at the heart of Asia, coupled with its well-developed infrastructure, makes it an ideal hub for import and export businesses. The country has a robust manufacturing sector, producing everything from automobiles to electronics and food products, much of which are exported worldwide. At the same time, there is a strong demand for imported goods, including machinery, raw materials, and consumer products.</p>



<p>Foreign businesses can tap into this vibrant trade sector by setting up import/export companies. These businesses can act as intermediaries, sourcing products from overseas to sell in the Thai market, or exporting Thai-made products to foreign markets. With the right market research and business strategy, an import/export business can be a profitable venture.</p>



<p>A foreigner can own an import/export business in Thailand. Import/export businesses are not included in the lists of business categories restricted to foreigners under the Foreign Business Act (FBA). This means that a foreigner can own 100% of an import/export business without needing to obtain a Foreign Business License or having to partner with a Thai national.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that even though import/export businesses are not restricted under the FBA, they may still need to comply with other regulations and requirements. For example, they may need to obtain import/export licenses or comply with customs regulations. Therefore, it&#8217;s recommended to consult with a legal professional or a business consultant who is familiar with Thai law and the import/export sector.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Requirements_for_setting_up_an_importexport_business_in_Thailand_as_a_foreigner"></span>Requirements for setting up an import/export business in Thailand as a foreigner<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>



<p>Setting up an import/export business in Thailand as a foreigner involves several steps:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Business Registration</strong>: The first step is to register the business with the Department of Business Development (DBD). This involves submitting the necessary documents, including the business plan, company name, list of shareholders, and company statutes.</li>



<li><strong>Tax Registration</strong>: After registering the business, it needs to obtain a tax ID from the Revenue Department within 60 days. This ID is necessary for tax filing and other business transactions.</li>



<li><strong>Import/Export License</strong>: The business may need to obtain an import/export license from the Ministry of Commerce. This involves submitting an application along with the necessary documents, such as a copy of the company&#8217;s registration and tax ID.</li>



<li><strong>Customs Registration</strong>: The business also needs to register with the Customs Department. This involves submitting an application along with the necessary documents, such as a copy of the import/export license.</li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Can_a_foreigner_own_a_business_that_importsexports_precious_metals_and_jewelry_in_Thailand"></span>Can a foreigner own a business that imports/exports precious metals and jewelry in Thailand?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>



<p>The import and export of precious metals and jewelry in Thailand is a regulated activity. While a foreigner can own an import/export business, the import and export of precious metals and jewelry may require specific licenses. For instance, the import of gold into Thailand requires a license from the Ministry of Commerce. Similarly, the export of gold and other precious metals is also regulated and may require a license.</p>



<p>Setting up a business that imports or exports precious metals and jewelry in Thailand involves several steps:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Business Registration</strong>: As with any business, the first step is to register the business with the Department of Business Development (DBD). This involves submitting the necessary documents, including the business plan, company name, list of shareholders, and company statutes.</li>



<li><strong>Tax Registration</strong>: After registering the business, it needs to obtain a tax ID from the Revenue Department within 60 days. This ID is necessary for tax filing and other business transactions.</li>



<li><strong>Import/Export License</strong>: The business will likely need to obtain an import/export license from the Ministry of Commerce. This involves submitting an application along with the necessary documents, such as a copy of the company&#8217;s registration and tax ID.</li>



<li><strong>Special Licenses</strong>: Given the nature of the business, there may be additional licenses required for the import/export of precious metals and jewelry. These licenses are typically issued by the Ministry of Commerce and may require additional documentation and compliance with specific regulations.</li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Technology_and_Innovation"></span>Technology and Innovation<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Thailand is keen on promoting technology and innovation as key drivers of its economy. The government has launched several initiatives to attract foreign investment in tech industries, including software development, fintech, e-commerce, and digital content. The Board of Investment (BOI) offers attractive incentives for foreign businesses in these sectors, including tax breaks and permission to own land.</p>



<p>Moreover, Thailand&#8217;s digital economy is growing rapidly, fueled by a high internet penetration rate and a tech-savvy population. This presents opportunities for foreign businesses to offer innovative digital services and products to the Thai market.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Tourism_and_Hospitality"></span>Tourism and Hospitality<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Thailand is one of the world&#8217;s top tourist destinations, attracting millions of visitors each year. The country&#8217;s rich cultural heritage, beautiful landscapes, and renowned hospitality make it a magnet for tourists. This vibrant tourism industry presents numerous opportunities for foreign businesses, from hotels and resorts to travel agencies and tour operators.</p>



<p>While the hospitality sector is competitive, there is still room for businesses that offer unique and high-quality services. For instance, luxury wellness retreats, eco-tourism ventures, and boutique travel agencies that offer personalized experiences are in high demand.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Real_Estate"></span>Real Estate<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Thailand&#8217;s real estate market is another sector with potential for foreign investors. The demand for residential and commercial properties is high, particularly in major cities like Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Phuket. While foreign ownership of land is restricted, foreigners can own buildings outright and can hold long-term leases on land.</p>



<p>Foreign businesses can tap into the real estate market in various ways. For instance, they can set up property management companies, real estate agencies, or construction businesses. They can also invest in real estate development projects through joint ventures with Thai partners.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Education_and_Training"></span>Education and Training<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>With the Thai government&#8217;s focus on improving the country&#8217;s human capital, there is a growing demand for quality education and training services. Foreign businesses can tap into this demand by setting up international schools, language centers, or professional training institutes. There is also a demand for online learning platforms, which can be an attractive option for tech-oriented businesses.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while there are restrictions on foreign businesses in Thailand, there are also numerous opportunities. The key is to understand the legal landscape, identify the right sector, and develop a business model that meets the needs of the Thai market. With the right approach, foreign businesses can find success in the Land of Smiles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Navigating_Business_Restrictions"></span>Navigating Business Restrictions<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>While Thailand offers a wealth of opportunities for foreign businesses, it also imposes certain restrictions that entrepreneurs need to navigate. Understanding these restrictions and finding ways to work within the legal framework is crucial for the success of any foreign business venture in Thailand.</p>



<p>One of the main restrictions is the limitation on foreign ownership in certain business categories, as outlined in the Foreign Business Act. However, there are strategies to navigate these restrictions. For instance, foreign businesses can partner with Thai companies or individuals, or they can seek special permissions and licenses, such as the Foreign Business License, to operate in restricted sectors.</p>



<p>A common practice among foreign businesses in Thailand is the use of Thai nominee shareholders. This involves having Thai individuals or companies hold shares on behalf of the foreign business, thereby giving the appearance of Thai majority ownership. However, this practice is fraught with legal risks. Under the Foreign Business Act, the use of nominee shareholders is illegal and can lead to severe penalties. Therefore, foreign businesses should be cautious about using this strategy and should seek professional legal advice.</p>



<p>Another option for foreign businesses is to operate through a Thai limited company. Under Thai law, a company is considered Thai if at least 50% of its shares are held by Thai nationals. However, the law allows foreigners to hold a majority of voting rights in a Thai company, which means that foreign investors can maintain control over the company&#8217;s operations while complying with the law. This can be a viable strategy for foreign businesses looking to operate in sectors that are otherwise restricted to them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Leveraging_International_Treaties"></span>Leveraging International Treaties<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>International treaties can also provide avenues for foreign businesses to operate in Thailand. One such treaty is the U.S.-Thai Amity Treaty. This treaty, signed between the United States and Thailand, grants special rights and benefits to American businesses operating in Thailand. Under the treaty, American businesses are allowed to maintain a majority ownership in a Thai company and are exempt from most of the restrictions imposed by the Foreign Business Act.</p>



<p>The U.S.-Thai Amity Treaty essentially grants national treatment to American businesses, meaning they are treated the same as Thai businesses. This can be a significant advantage for American entrepreneurs looking to start a business in Thailand.</p>



<p>In addition to the U.S.-Thai Amity Treaty, there are other treaties and agreements that can benefit foreign businesses in Thailand. For instance, the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement (ACIA) provides protections and guarantees for investors from ASEAN member countries. Similarly, Thailand has bilateral investment treaties with several countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and China, which provide certain protections and benefits to investors from these countries.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while there are restrictions on foreign businesses in Thailand, there are also strategies to navigate these restrictions and opportunities to leverage international treaties. With careful planning and the right legal advice, foreign entrepreneurs can successfully start and operate a business in Thailand.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Steps_to_Starting_a_Business_in_Thailand"></span>Steps to Starting a Business in Thailand<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Starting a business in Thailand involves a series of steps, each with its own set of requirements and procedures. Here&#8217;s a more detailed look at each step:</p>



<p></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Choosing a Business Structure</strong>: The next step is to decide on the legal structure of your business. This could be a sole proprietorship, a partnership, or a limited company. Each structure has its own legal and tax implications. For instance, a sole proprietorship is the simplest form of business, but it also exposes the owner to unlimited liability. A limited company, on the other hand, offers liability protection but requires more paperwork and compliance. It&#8217;s important to choose the structure that best suits your business needs and risk tolerance.</li>



<li><strong>Registering Your Business</strong>: Once you&#8217;ve chosen a business structure, you need to register your business with the Department of Business Development (DBD). This involves submitting the necessary documents, including your business plan, company name, list of shareholders, and company statutes. The company name must be unique and not already in use by another company. The list of shareholders must include their names, addresses, and number of shares held. The company statutes should outline the company&#8217;s objectives, rules, and procedures.</li>



<li><strong>Obtaining a Tax ID</strong>: After registering your business, you need to obtain a tax ID from the Revenue Department within 60 days. This ID is necessary for tax filing and other business transactions. The process involves filling out a form and providing details about your business, including its name, address, and type of business. Once you&#8217;ve obtained your tax ID, you should display it prominently at your place of business.</li>



<li><strong>Applying for a Foreign Business License</strong>: If you&#8217;re a foreigner looking to operate a business in a sector that&#8217;s restricted under the Foreign Business Act, you need to apply for a Foreign Business License. This involves submitting an application to the DBD, along with supporting documents such as your business plan, list of shareholders, and proof of financial status. The DBD will review your application and may request additional information or documents. If your application is approved, you&#8217;ll receive your Foreign Business License, which allows you to legally operate your business in Thailand. However, the process can take several months and there&#8217;s no guarantee of approval, so it&#8217;s important to plan accordingly.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_Can_a_foreigner_own_100_of_a_business_in_Thailand"></span><strong>Q: Can a foreigner own 100% of a business in Thailand?</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>A: The Foreign Business Act (FBA) in Thailand does impose restrictions on foreign ownership in certain business categories. However, there are sectors where foreigners can own 100% of the business. For instance, manufacturing businesses, export businesses, and certain types of service businesses are not restricted under the FBA. This means that a foreigner can fully own a business in these sectors without needing to obtain a Foreign Business License or having to partner with a Thai national.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that even in these unrestricted sectors, there may be other regulations and requirements that foreign businesses need to comply with. For example, certain types of manufacturing may require environmental permits, while service businesses may need to comply with specific professional licensing requirements.</p>



<p>Given the complexity of Thai business laws and regulations, it&#8217;s highly recommended that foreign entrepreneurs consult with a legal professional or a business consultant who is familiar with Thai law. This will help ensure that you understand all the legal requirements and restrictions, and that your business is set up in compliance with Thai law.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_What_are_the_penalties_for_violating_the_Foreign_Business_Act"></span><strong>Q: What are the penalties for violating the Foreign Business Act?</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>A: Violations of the Foreign Business Act can result in severe penalties. For instance, if a foreigner operates a business in a category that is restricted under the FBA without obtaining a Foreign Business License, they can be fined up to 100,000 Baht. In addition, they can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to three years, or both.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if a foreigner uses Thai nominee shareholders to circumvent the FBA&#8217;s restrictions on foreign ownership, they can be subject to penalties. The FBA defines a nominee shareholder as a Thai individual or company that holds shares on behalf of a foreigner. This practice is illegal under the FBA, and both the foreigner and the nominee shareholder can be subject to penalties, including fines and imprisonment.</p>



<p>Given these severe penalties, it&#8217;s crucial for foreign entrepreneurs to ensure that their business operations are in full compliance with the FBA and other relevant Thai laws.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_Can_a_foreigner_buy_land_in_Thailand"></span><strong>Q: Can a foreigner buy land in Thailand?</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>A: Under Thai law, foreigners are generally prohibited from owning land in Thailand. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For instance, a foreigner who invests at least 40 million Baht (approximately 1.2 million USD) in Thailand can buy up to 1 rai (approximately 1,600 square meters) of land for residential use. This investment needs to be maintained for at least five years.</p>



<p>In addition, foreign-owned companies can own land under certain conditions. For example, a company that is registered in Thailand and has majority Thai ownership can own land. However, if the company is deemed to be using Thai shareholders as nominees for the foreign owners, it can be subject to penalties.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that while foreigners cannot generally own land in Thailand, they can own buildings and structures on the land. Therefore, a common practice among foreigners is to lease land and then build on it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_What_are_the_benefits_of_obtaining_a_Foreign_Business_License_in_Thailand"></span>Q: What are the benefits of obtaining a Foreign Business License in Thailand?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>A: Obtaining a Foreign Business License (FBL) in Thailand allows a foreigner or a foreign-owned company to operate a business in sectors that are otherwise restricted under the Foreign Business Act (FBA). This includes businesses in List Two and List Three of the FBA, which cover sectors such as agriculture, industry, and services.</p>



<p>With an FBL, a foreign-owned company can hold more than 49% of the shares, and in some cases, up to 100% of the shares. This allows the foreign owner to maintain control over the company&#8217;s operations and management.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that obtaining an FBL can be a complex and time-consuming process, and there&#8217;s no guarantee of approval. Therefore, it&#8217;s recommended to consult with a legal professional or a business consultant who is familiar with Thai law.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_How_does_the_US-Thai_Amity_Treaty_benefit_American_businesses_in_Thailand"></span>Q: How does the U.S.-Thai Amity Treaty benefit American businesses in Thailand?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>A: The U.S.-Thai Amity Treaty is a special agreement between the United States and Thailand that grants significant benefits to American businesses operating in Thailand. Under the treaty, American businesses are treated similarly to Thai businesses, meaning they are exempt from most of the restrictions imposed by the Foreign Business Act.</p>



<p>One of the key benefits of the treaty is that it allows American businesses to maintain majority ownership in a Thai company. This means that American entrepreneurs can control and manage their businesses without needing to partner with Thai nationals or companies.</p>



<p>The treaty also provides protection for American investments in Thailand, including protection against expropriation and the right to transfer funds out of Thailand in any freely convertible currency.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that the treaty does not grant American businesses the right to own land in Thailand. Land ownership is still subject to Thai laws and regulations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_What_are_the_key_considerations_for_a_foreigner_looking_to_start_a_business_in_Thailand"></span>Q: What are the key considerations for a foreigner looking to start a business in Thailand?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>A: Starting a business in Thailand as a foreigner involves several key considerations. First, it&#8217;s important to understand the legal landscape, including the Foreign Business Act and other relevant laws. This will help you understand the types of businesses you can engage in, the percentage of ownership you can hold, and the processes you need to follow to legally operate in Thailand.</p>



<p>Second, you need to identify the right business sector. While there are restrictions on foreign businesses in certain sectors, there are also numerous opportunities in sectors such as manufacturing, export, technology, tourism, and real estate.</p>



<p>Third, you need to navigate the business registration and licensing processes. This involves registering your business with the Department of Business Development, obtaining a tax ID, and if necessary, applying for a Foreign Business License.</p>



<p>Lastly, it&#8217;s crucial to understand the cultural and business norms in Thailand. Doing business in Thailand may be different from what you&#8217;re used to in your home country, so it&#8217;s important to understand and respect these differences to build successful business relationships.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_What_is_the_process_for_registering_a_company_in_Thailand_as_a_foreigner"></span>Q: What is the process for registering a company in Thailand as a foreigner?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>A: Registering a company in Thailand as a foreigner involves several steps:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Name Reservation</strong>: The first step is to reserve a company name with the Department of Business Development (DBD). The name should not be the same or similar to that of other companies. Once approved, the name reservation is valid for 30 days.</li>



<li><strong>Filing of Memorandum of Association</strong>: The next step is to file a Memorandum of Association with the DBD. The Memorandum should include the name of the company, the province where the company will be located, the business objectives, the capital to be registered, and the names of the shareholders.</li>



<li><strong>Convening of Statutory Meeting</strong>: Once the Memorandum is filed, a statutory meeting is held to establish the articles of association and bylaws, and to elect directors and auditors.</li>



<li><strong>Registration</strong>: Within three months of the statutory meeting, the company must be registered. This involves submitting the application form and relevant documents to the DBD.</li>



<li><strong>Tax Registration</strong>: After the company is registered, it must obtain a tax ID card and VAT certificate from the Revenue Department within 60 days.</li>
</ol>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the process can be complex and requires a good understanding of Thai law. Therefore, it&#8217;s recommended to engage a legal professional or a business consultant to assist with the registration process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_What_are_the_requirements_for_foreign_directors_in_a_Thai_company"></span>Q: What are the requirements for foreign directors in a Thai company?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>A: A foreigner can be a director of a Thai company. However, to work legally in Thailand, the foreign director must obtain a work permit. This involves submitting an application to the Ministry of Labor, along with the necessary documents, such as a copy of the company&#8217;s registration, a list of shareholders, and the employment contract.</p>



<p>In addition, the foreign director must have a valid visa to stay in Thailand. This could be a business visa, which can be obtained from a Thai embassy or consulate in the foreign director&#8217;s home country.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the process of obtaining a work permit and visa can be complex and time-consuming. Therefore, it&#8217;s recommended to seek professional advice to ensure compliance with Thai immigration and labor laws.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_Can_a_foreign-owned_company_in_Thailand_hire_foreign_employees"></span>Q: Can a foreign-owned company in Thailand hire foreign employees?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>A: Yes, a foreign-owned company in Thailand can hire foreign employees. However, the company must comply with Thai labor laws and immigration regulations.</p>



<p>Firstly, the company must obtain a work permit for each foreign employee. This involves submitting an application to the Ministry of Labor, along with the necessary documents.</p>



<p>Secondly, the foreign employee must have a valid visa to stay in Thailand. This could be a business visa or a dependent visa, depending on the employee&#8217;s circumstances.</p>



<p>Lastly, the company must comply with the rules on the ratio of foreign to Thai employees. Under Thai law, a company is generally required to employ four Thai employees for each foreign employee. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as for BOI-promoted companies or companies operating under certain international treaties.</p>
