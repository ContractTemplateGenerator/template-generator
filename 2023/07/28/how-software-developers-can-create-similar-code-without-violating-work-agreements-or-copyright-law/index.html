      <h1>How Software Developers Can Create Similar Code Without Violating Work Agreements or Copyright Law</h1>
      <div class="meta">Published: July 28, 2023 • Contractors &amp; Employees, Software</div>
      <div class="content">
<p>Every day, software developers around the world find themselves tasked with creating solutions to problems that might already have been addressed elsewhere. However, the existence of prior work doesn&#8217;t grant carte blanche to use that material. Indeed, developers often face contractual limitations in the form of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), confidentiality clauses, trade secret provisions, and the overarching constraint of copyright law. So, how can a developer create software that might be functionally similar, but legally distinct from pre-existing work?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_Legal_Landscape"></span>The Legal Landscape<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Before we delve into the how, it&#8217;s important to understand the what. As a developer, you&#8217;re likely aware that the code you write is protected by copyright law. This includes any code written as part of a contractual agreement. In addition, your work agreement likely contains clauses related to confidentiality and trade secrets, which further limit how you can use the information and materials you accessed during your employment.</p>



<p>Moreover, it&#8217;s crucial to understand the concept of a &#8216;derivative work&#8217;. The U.S. Copyright Act defines a derivative work as a work based upon one or more pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. In the software development world, a derivative work might involve modifying existing code, creating a new program based on the structure, sequence, and organization of another, or copying and pasting portions of code into a new program.</p>



<p>Now that we&#8217;ve laid the groundwork, let&#8217;s explore how you can navigate this landscape.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Tips_for_Creating_Legally_Distinct_Software"></span>Tips for Creating Legally Distinct Software<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Understand Your Agreement</strong>: Before starting any new project, revisit the terms of your work agreement. Understand what it permits and prohibits, and identify any gray areas that might require legal consultation.</li>



<li><strong>Recreate Functionality, Not Code</strong>: It&#8217;s generally acceptable to create a product that serves the same function as an existing one, as long as you don&#8217;t copy the code or unique design elements. Your aim should be to create a new solution to the problem, not to replicate the existing one.</li>



<li><strong>No Direct Copying</strong>: Do not directly copy and paste code from your previous work or any other proprietary software. Even if you change variable names or make other superficial modifications, if the underlying logic and structure are the same, it may be considered a derivative work.</li>



<li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: Step back and think about the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve. Try to abstract it away from the specific solution you previously developed. This may lead you to a new, non-derivative solution.</li>



<li><strong>Clean Room Design</strong>: This technique can be helpful when you want to create software that&#8217;s compatible with existing software. It involves a team that studies the existing software and writes a specification, and a separate team that uses the specification to create the new software. The key is to isolate the second team from the original software to prevent them from copying it.</li>



<li><strong>Maintain Detailed Documentation</strong>: Keep thorough records of your development process, including how you came up with ideas and how you solved problems. This can serve as evidence that your work is original and not derivative, should a dispute arise.</li>



<li><strong>Consult with a Lawyer</strong>: When in doubt, consult with a legal professional who is familiar with intellectual property law. They can provide advice tailored to your specific situation and can help you navigate any legal gray areas.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_is_a_derivative_work"></span>What is a derivative work?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>A derivative work is a new, original product that includes aspects of a previously existing, copyrighted work. This can include adaptations, translations, musical arrangements, and in the case of software, modifications or enhancements to preexisting code. The copyright of the derivative work only extends to the new material added by the creator and not the preexisting copyrighted work.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_can_I_avoid_creating_a_derivative_work"></span>How can I avoid creating a derivative work?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>The best way to avoid creating a derivative work is to write your own code from scratch. Understanding the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve can help you develop original solutions rather than simply copying another&#8217;s solution. Avoid copying and pasting code from other sources unless you have permission or the code is open source or free to use.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_is_protected_under_copyright_law_in_software_development"></span>What is protected under copyright law in software development?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Copyright law protects the specific code written by a developer, which is considered the expression of an idea. However, the underlying functionality or algorithms may not be protected by copyright. That said, complex algorithms may be protected under patent law, which is a separate area of law.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_are_trade_secrets_in_software_development"></span>What are trade secrets in software development?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Trade secrets in software development can be a particular method of coding, an algorithm, or a method of operation. If you have access to trade secrets as part of your work agreement, you must not use or disclose them without permission.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_can_I_create_software_similar_to_an_existing_one_without_infringing_on_copyrights"></span>How can I create software similar to an existing one without infringing on copyrights?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Creating similar software without infringing copyrights involves writing your own code to achieve the same functionality, without directly copying the original code. Be mindful of trade secrets and respect the terms of any work agreements or non-disclosure agreements you might have. Always seek legal advice if you&#8217;re unsure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Can_I_use_open-source_software_in_my_work"></span>Can I use open-source software in my work?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Yes, you can use open-source software in your work, but you need to be aware of the terms and conditions outlined in the software&#8217;s license. Not all open-source software is free to use for all purposes, and some licenses require you to share any modifications or enhancements you make to the open-source code.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_should_I_do_if_Im_unsure_about_whether_my_work_might_infringe_on_anothers_copyright"></span>What should I do if I&#8217;m unsure about whether my work might infringe on another&#8217;s copyright?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re unsure about whether your work might infringe on another&#8217;s copyright or violate a work agreement, it&#8217;s a good idea to seek legal advice. A lawyer with expertise in intellectual property and employment law can provide guidance and help you navigate these complex issues.</p>
