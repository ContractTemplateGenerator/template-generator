<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_Purpose_of_a_Wholesale_Agreement"></span>The Purpose of a Wholesale Agreement<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>A wholesale agreement is a legally binding contract between a wholesaler (the seller) and a buyer, which could be a retailer, distributor, or another wholesaler. The agreement outlines the terms and conditions of the sale and purchase of products, ensuring that both parties are fully aware of their rights, obligations, and the consequences of not meeting these obligations.</p>



<p>This document is instrumental in preventing misunderstandings that could lead to disputes. It also provides a clear roadmap for the course of the business relationship, detailing every facet from ordering procedures to return policies, exclusivity agreements, confidentiality clauses, and pricing policies, including the MAP policy.</p>

<p>The Minimum Advertised Price policy is a vendor&#8217;s policy that sets the lowest price at which a retailer can advertise the vendor&#8217;s products. It&#8217;s important to note that the MAP policy doesn&#8217;t dictate the selling price; it merely sets a boundary for the advertised price. This policy helps maintain the perceived value of products, prevent price wars, and ensure that small and large retailers can compete fairly.</p>
