<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) website, SEC.gov, as well as other publications like Morningstar (as well as a company&#8217;s website), provide access to already-released earnings reports. These earnings reports function as public balance sheets and are all released at around the same time. As a consequence, with each new news during this time, stocks may fluctuate. An earnings report, however, may not always provide information regarding a stock&#8217;s long-term health. It&#8217;s crucial to use caution when using the data provided in an earnings announcement.</p>



<p><strong>How to Use Nasdaq to Track Earnings Reports<br></strong>A list of upcoming earnings reports may be found on the Nasdaq online earnings calendar. To get a quick rundown of the most important details, you may search for a firm based on a certain release date or by ticker symbol.</p>



<p>For instance, you may see publications that were published on the current day, and these reports contain key data elements like market capitalization, consensus EPS projections, and EPS from the previous year.</p>



<p><strong>Tracking Earnings Reports: A Guide Using EDGAR from the SEC<br></strong>The Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) website is the most reliable and comprehensive source for all earnings reports (SEC.gov). You may look up and view quarterly, annual, 10-Q, and 10-K reports for any publicly listed firm using their EDGAR system. EDGAR is a searchable database of almost twenty years of electronic filings. Users may search the database in the same way they would an internet search, by entering the name of a firm or a person. Search results may be limited down further by date, location of the company&#8217;s executive offices, or file type.</p>



<p>EDGAR may be used to study mutual funds, variable insurance products, or confidential treatment orders in addition to corporate data. These are orders that limit access to data that would otherwise be needed to be submitted.</p>



<p>The 10-Q form and the quarterly earnings report are often confused. This makes sense given that both of them are based on quarterly data. The 10-Q, on the other hand, is a significantly lengthier document that is chock-full of financial data in black and white. This may make it difficult to read, but it also spares investors some of the unnecessary details that are often included in the official earnings report.</p>



<p><strong>Conference Calls for Earnings<br></strong>In general, the general public may listen to earnings calls. You may often hear the call live on a phone or mobile device if you maintain track of when earnings calls are scheduled to occur. These earnings calls may provide more information about a company&#8217;s financial situation than quarterly earnings releases.</p>



<p>You may also listen to earnings conference calls online; you can often find them on the investor relations section of a company&#8217;s website. For a while after the actual call, many firms make the earnings calls accessible on their company websites, enabling investors to access and evaluate important data.</p>



<p><strong>How far back can the EDGAR database be traced?<br></strong>EDGAR records may be found dating back to 1995 or 1994. Earlier paper filings may be obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>



<p><strong>How Was EDGAR Hacked?<br></strong>In 2016, a Ukrainian hacker exploited stolen login credentials to view unreleased files on the EDGAR system. This information was subsequently passed on to traders, who were able to profit from early access to business reporting numbers before they were released.</p>



<p><strong>What Exactly Is EDGAR Filer Management?<br></strong>Edgar Filer Management is a website that allows firms and individuals to make electronic filings to the SEC. This is more difficult than searching the EDGAR database, and Filers must submit a Form ID for authorisation before they may generate an access code.</p>



<p><strong>How Do You Search the EDGAR Database for a Proxy Document?<br></strong>A proxy file, or any other public filing, may be found by searching the EDGAR database by business name. Additional criteria, such as filing date or category, may be required to narrow the search results. Form 14K is used to submit proxy statements.</p>



<p><strong>What Is the Canadian Version of EDGAR?<br></strong>The System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) is a platform used by Canadian public corporations and securities issuers for electronic reporting. The Canadian Securities Authority maintains the Canadian counterpart of EDGAR (CSA).</p>



<p>Bottom Line EDGAR is a simple method to get electronic reports from any public firm in the United States. The search feature, on the other hand, might be cumbersome and unintuitive. In this day and age, most of this information may be discovered just as simply on a corporate website.</p>
