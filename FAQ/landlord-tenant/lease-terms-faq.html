Under California Civil Code Section 1951.2, when a tenant breaks a lease, the landlord cannot simply collect the full remaining rent without making reasonable efforts to re-rent the unit. The landlord must actively advertise and show the property to prospective tenants at a fair market rental rate. If the landlord finds a new tenant, your liability ends when that tenant takes possession. Your potential liability includes rent until a new tenant moves in or the lease expires, whichever comes first, the difference if the new rent is lower than your lease rate, reasonable costs of re-renting such as advertising and cleaning, and any other damages caused by your early departure. However, you cannot be held responsible for rent the landlord could have avoided losing through reasonable mitigation efforts. Document your unit's condition when you leave and request updates on re-renting efforts. Some landlords may agree to accept a lease termination fee in exchange for releasing you from the lease, which can provide certainty about your total liability."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Whether you can sublet your California apartment without landlord permission depends on your lease terms. California Civil Code Section 1995.230 provides that if your lease does not address subletting, you have the right to sublet without requiring landlord consent. However, most written leases contain clauses requiring landlord approval before subletting. When approval is required, your landlord must act reasonably in deciding whether to approve a sublet request. Under Civil Code Section 1995.260, a landlord cannot unreasonably withhold consent to a sublet if the proposed subtenant is financially qualified, agrees to the lease terms, and the landlord has no other legitimate reason to refuse. Landlords may legally deny sublet requests if the proposed subtenant has poor credit or rental history, refuses to complete a rental application, intends to use the unit for an illegal purpose, or would result in overcrowding beyond the unit's capacity. If your landlord unreasonably refuses to allow a sublet, you may have grounds to break your lease without penalty. San Francisco has particularly strong sublet protections under its rent ordinance, requiring landlords to allow tenants to replace departing roommates under certain conditions."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "California law provides several legal justifications for tenants to break a lease without penalty. Active military duty under the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act allows military members to terminate residential leases after receiving deployment orders or permanent change of station orders with proper notice. Domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault victims can terminate a lease under Civil Code Section 1946.7 by providing written notice and documentation such as a police report, protective order, or qualified third-party documentation. Uninhabitable conditions that violate the implied warranty of habitability under Civil Code Section 1942 allow tenants to vacate if the landlord fails to make repairs after proper notice. Landlord harassment or illegal entry violating Civil Code Section 1954 that substantially interferes with your tenancy may justify lease termination. If the landlord significantly breaches the lease terms or fails to provide disclosed amenities, you may have grounds to terminate. Senior citizens or disabled tenants may have additional rights to terminate if moving to a care facility. Additionally, if the unit becomes unsafe due to natural disasters or government-ordered closures, you may be released from lease obligations. Always document the conditions or circumstances justifying your departure and provide written notice to your landlord."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The notice required to end your lease in California depends on your tenancy type. For fixed-term leases, you generally do not need to give notice if you plan to move out when the lease expires on its stated end date. However, many leases contain automatic renewal clauses that convert to month-to-month tenancies, so review your lease for any notice requirements to prevent automatic renewal. For month-to-month tenancies, California Civil Code Section 1946 requires tenants to provide at least 30 days written notice before moving out. The notice period begins when the landlord receives your notice and must end on the last day of a rental period. For example, if you pay rent on the first of the month and give notice on June 15, your notice period runs until July 15, and you would owe prorated rent through that date. Notice should be provided in writing and delivered by methods that create proof of receipt, such as certified mail, email with delivery confirmation, or hand delivery with a signed acknowledgment. Some local ordinances or specific lease terms may require longer notice periods, so always check both your lease agreement and any applicable local tenant protection laws."

Most leases contain occupancy clauses that require landlord approval before adding new occupants. When you request to add a roommate, the landlord may require the proposed roommate to complete an application, pass credit and background checks, and meet the same qualification standards applied to all tenants. Landlords cannot discriminate against prospective roommates based on race, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, source of income, or other protected characteristics under the Fair Employment and Housing Act. Local ordinances may provide additional protections, with San Francisco's rent ordinance being particularly tenant-friendly regarding roommates and replacement of departing co-tenants. Reasonable occupancy limits based on square footage and local codes are permissible, with the general standard being two persons per bedroom plus one. If your landlord unreasonably refuses a qualified roommate, you may file a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing or seek legal assistance from a tenant rights organization."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "California law renders numerous lease clauses void and unenforceable, even if you signed agreeing to them. Under Civil Code Section 1953, landlords cannot enforce clauses that waive the tenant's rights under California tenant protection laws, limit landlord liability for injuries caused by landlord negligence, require the tenant to pay attorney fees regardless of who prevails in a dispute, or waive the implied warranty of habitability. Other unenforceable provisions include clauses requiring tenants to waive their right to a jury trial in eviction proceedings, provisions charging excessive late fees beyond reasonable estimates of actual damages, clauses requiring tenants to pay for routine maintenance that is the landlord's responsibility, automatic renewal clauses that do not comply with notice requirements, clauses requiring tenants to waive relocation assistance rights under AB 1482, provisions purporting to exempt the landlord from fair housing obligations, and clauses allowing entry without proper notice except in emergencies. Security deposit terms that exceed legal limits or claim deposits are non-refundable are also void. If your lease contains these provisions, they are simply unenforceable, and you cannot be penalized for refusing to comply with illegal terms. Landlords who attempt to enforce void clauses may be liable for damages and attorney fees."

Your notice should be in writing and include the date of the notice, your name and the rental address, a clear statement that you are terminating your tenancy, the date you will vacate the premises, your forwarding address for security deposit return, and your signature. For month-to-month tenancies, provide at least 30 days notice under Civil Code Section 1946. Calculate the end date carefully since notice begins when the landlord receives it, not when you send it. For fixed-term leases, check whether notice is required before the lease end date to prevent automatic renewal. Deliver your notice through methods that create proof of receipt including certified mail with return receipt, personal delivery with signed acknowledgment, or email if your lease specifically allows electronic notice. Keep copies of everything you send. After giving notice, fulfill your remaining obligations including paying rent through your notice period, maintaining the unit in good condition, allowing reasonable access for showings to prospective tenants, and removing all belongings and returning keys by the termination date. Document the unit's condition with photos when you leave."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "If your California landlord wants to terminate your lease early, your options depend on the reason for termination and whether your property is covered by just cause eviction protections. For fixed-term leases, landlords generally cannot terminate before the lease expires unless you have violated the lease terms and received proper notice to cure or quit. Under AB 1482, properties covered by just cause protections require landlords to have a legally valid reason for termination after you have been in possession for 12 months. At-fault causes require landlords to give you notice and opportunity to cure most violations before proceeding with eviction. For no-fault terminations such as owner move-in, substantial renovation, or withdrawal from the rental market, landlords must provide relocation assistance equal to one month's rent. If your landlord offers a buyout to leave early, you have the right to negotiate the amount and terms. Under Civil Code Section 1946.2, buyout offers must be made in writing and include notice of your right to consult an attorney and rescind acceptance within 30 days. You are never required to accept a buyout offer. If you believe the termination is improper, consult with a tenant rights organization or attorney before vacating, as you may have defenses to any eviction action."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Transferring your lease to another person, known as lease assignment, is possible in California but typically requires landlord consent. Assignment differs from subletting because you transfer all your rights and obligations to the new tenant and remove yourself from the lease entirely, while subletting maintains your primary tenant status with the subtenant owing obligations to you. Most leases require written landlord approval for assignments, and Civil Code Section 1995.230 states that if your lease is silent on assignment, you may assign without consent. However, if your lease prohibits assignment or requires approval, you must obtain the landlord's agreement. When consent is required, landlords must act reasonably under Civil Code Section 1995.260, meaning they cannot unreasonably withhold approval if the proposed assignee is qualified. Reasonable grounds for denial include poor credit history, insufficient income, prior evictions, refusal to complete the application process, or incompatible use of the premises. Landlords may charge a reasonable fee for processing the assignment request but cannot use fees to discourage assignments. In rent-controlled jurisdictions, assignment rights may be more robust, and some local ordinances require landlords to accept qualified replacement tenants. Always request assignment approval in writing and keep documentation of your request and the landlord's response."

            "text": "When a rental property is sold in California, your existing lease remains in effect and binding on the new owner. Under general property law principles, leases run with the land, meaning the new landlord steps into the shoes of the previous landlord and must honor all terms of your lease agreement. Your rent cannot be increased except as permitted by your lease terms and rent control laws, your security deposit transfers to the new owner who becomes responsible for returning it, and all lease terms including amenities, parking, and other provisions remain enforceable. Under AB 1482, if your property is covered by just cause eviction protections, the new owner cannot simply terminate your tenancy to move in or renovate without following proper procedures and providing relocation assistance. Owner move-in evictions have specific requirements including good faith intent to occupy the unit as a primary residence for at least 36 months. The new owner must provide written notice of the ownership change, including their name and address for rent payment and service of notices. You should request documentation of the sale and confirm where to send rent payments. If the new owner attempts to change your lease terms, raise your rent beyond legal limits, or evict you without just cause, you have the same rights and protections as you did with the previous landlord."

                    <span>Q: Can I sublet my apartment in California without landlord permission?</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Whether you can sublet your California apartment without landlord permission depends on your lease terms. California Civil Code Section 1995.230 provides that if your lease does not address subletting, you have the right to sublet without requiring landlord consent. However, most written leases contain clauses requiring landlord approval before subletting.</p>
                    <p>When approval is required, your landlord must act reasonably in deciding whether to approve a sublet request. Under Civil Code Section 1995.260, a landlord cannot unreasonably withhold consent to a sublet if the proposed subtenant is financially qualified and agrees to the lease terms.</p>
                    <p><strong>Landlords may legally deny sublet requests if:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The proposed subtenant has poor credit or rental history</li>
                        <li>The subtenant refuses to complete a rental application</li>
                        <li>The subtenant intends to use the unit for an illegal purpose</li>
                        <li>The sublet would result in overcrowding beyond the unit's capacity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If your landlord unreasonably refuses to allow a sublet, you may have grounds to break your lease without penalty. San Francisco has particularly strong sublet protections requiring landlords to allow tenants to replace departing roommates under certain conditions.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The notice required to end your lease in California depends on your tenancy type:</p>
                    <p><strong>Fixed-term leases:</strong> You generally do not need to give notice if you plan to move out when the lease expires on its stated end date. However, review your lease for automatic renewal clauses that may require notice to prevent conversion to a month-to-month tenancy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Month-to-month tenancies:</strong> California Civil Code Section 1946 requires tenants to provide at least 30 days written notice before moving out. The notice period begins when the landlord receives your notice and must end on the last day of a rental period.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you pay rent on the first of the month and give notice on June 15, your notice period runs until July 15, and you would owe prorated rent through that date.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>California landlords have the right to approve or deny requests to add roommates, but they must exercise this right reasonably and in compliance with fair housing laws. Most leases contain occupancy clauses requiring landlord approval before adding new occupants.</p>
                    <p><strong>When you request to add a roommate, the landlord may require:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The proposed roommate to complete an application</li>
                        <li>Credit and background checks</li>
                        <li>The same qualification standards applied to all tenants</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Landlords cannot discriminate based on:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Race, religion, or national origin</li>
                        <li>Sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity</li>

                    <p>Local ordinances may provide additional protections. San Francisco's rent ordinance is particularly tenant-friendly regarding roommates. Reasonable occupancy limits based on square footage (generally two persons per bedroom plus one) are permissible.

                    <p>California law renders numerous lease clauses void and unenforceable, even if you signed agreeing to them. Under Civil Code Section 1953, landlords cannot enforce clauses that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Waive the tenant's rights under California tenant protection laws</li>

                    <p>If your California landlord wants to terminate your lease early, your options depend on the reason for termination and whether your property is covered by just cause eviction protections.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fixed-term leases:</strong> Landlords generally cannot terminate before the lease expires unless you have violated the lease terms and received proper notice to cure or quit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Under AB 1482 just cause protections:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At-fault causes require landlords to give you notice and opportunity to cure most violations before proceeding with eviction</li>
                        <li>No-fault terminations (owner move-in, substantial renovation, withdrawal from rental market) require relocation assistance equal to one month's rent</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Buyout offers:</strong> If your landlord offers a buyout to leave early, you have the right to negotiate. Under Civil Code Section 1946.2, buyout offers must be made in writing and include notice of your right to consult an attorney and rescind acceptance within 30 days. You are never required to accept a buyout.</p>
                    <p>If you believe the termination is improper, consult with a tenant rights organization or attorney before vacating, as you may have defenses to any eviction action.</p>

                    <p>Transferring your lease to another person, known as lease assignment, is possible in California but typically requires landlord consent.</p>
                    <p><strong>Assignment vs. Subletting:</strong></p>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Most leases require written landlord approval for assignments. Civil Code Section 1995.230 states that if your lease is silent on assignment, you may assign without consent.

                    <p><strong>Reasonable grounds for denial include:</strong></p>
                    <ul>

                    <p>When a rental property is sold in California, your existing lease remains in effect and binding on the new owner.
