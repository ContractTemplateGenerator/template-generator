Tenant damage, which can be deducted from your deposit, includes large holes in walls, burns or stains on carpets, broken windows or fixtures, excessive filth requiring professional cleaning, pet damage, and unauthorized alterations to the property.

If repairs are not yet completed within the 21-day period, the landlord must provide a good faith estimate of costs and then provide actual receipts within 14 days after the work is done. If the actual costs are less than the estimates, the landlord must refund the difference. The statement must be sent to the forwarding address you provided or, if none was provided, to the rental unit address.

Under Civil Code Section 1950.5(l), bad faith means the landlord knew they were not entitled to withhold the deposit or acted with intentional disregard of the tenant's rights. Examples of bad faith include fabricating damages, charging for pre-existing conditions, significantly overcharging for repairs, or failing to provide any itemized statement. To recover these penalties, you typically need to file a lawsuit in small claims court or civil court. Courts look at whether the landlord's conduct was intentional or merely negligent when determining bad faith penalties."

Second, send a demand letter to your landlord requesting the return of your deposit and giving them a reasonable deadline (typically 7-14 days). Third, if they do not comply, file a small claims case at the courthouse in the county where the rental property is located. The filing fee ranges from $30 to $75 depending on the claim amount. California small claims court allows claims up to $12,500 for individuals.

California landlords cannot automatically deduct professional carpet cleaning costs from your security deposit unless the carpets are damaged beyond normal wear and tear. If you left the carpets in the same condition as when you moved in, minus normal wear, the landlord cannot charge for cleaning. However, if there are stains, pet damage, burns, or excessive soiling that goes beyond normal use, the landlord may deduct reasonable cleaning costs. Some landlords include lease clauses requiring professional carpet cleaning upon move-out, but California courts have found such clauses to be unenforceable if they require cleaning regardless of the carpet's condition. Document the carpet's condition with photos at move-in and move-out to protect yourself against improper deductions."

This inspection allows you to identify and fix issues before final move-out. Take date-stamped photos and videos of every room, including closets, appliances, and fixtures. Clean the unit thoroughly, including appliances, windows, and fixtures. Repair any damage you caused, such as filling nail holes or touching up paint. Compare the unit's condition to your move-in inspection report. Return all keys, remotes, and access devices. Provide your landlord with a forwarding address in writing for the deposit return.

As of July 1, 2024, under AB 12, the security deposit limit for most residential tenancies is reduced to just one month's rent, regardless of whether the unit is furnished or unfurnished. There are exceptions for small landlords who own no more than two residential properties with no more than four units total. Military service members receive additional protections limiting deposits. The deposit limit includes all refundable deposits, including last month's rent if collected as a deposit. Any amount collected above these limits can be recovered by the tenant, and the landlord may face penalties."

            "text": "No, you cannot unilaterally decide to use your security deposit as last month's rent unless your landlord explicitly agrees. While some landlords may accept this arrangement, you do not have the legal right to withhold rent and apply your deposit without permission. If you fail to pay rent and claim your deposit should cover it, the landlord can pursue eviction for nonpayment of rent and potentially sue you for the unpaid amount. The security deposit serves a different legal purpose than rent payment - it secures the landlord against damages and unpaid obligations. If you want to use your deposit toward final rent, negotiate this with your landlord in writing before your move-out date. Some landlords prefer this arrangement to avoid the 21-day return process."

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>If a California landlord retains a security deposit in bad faith, they may be liable for up to twice the amount of the security deposit in statutory damages, in addition to returning the wrongfully withheld amount.</p>
                    <p>Under Civil Code Section 1950.5(l), bad faith means the landlord knew they were not entitled to withhold the deposit or acted with intentional disregard of the tenant's rights. Examples of bad faith include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fabricating damages</li>
                        <li>Charging for pre-existing conditions</li>
                        <li>Significantly overcharging for repairs</li>
                        <li>Failing to provide any itemized statement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To recover these penalties, you typically need to file a lawsuit in small claims court or civil court. Courts look at whether the landlord's conduct was intentional or merely negligent when determining bad faith penalties.</p>

                    <p><strong>Third,</strong> if they do not comply, file a small claims case at the courthouse in the county where the rental property is located. The filing fee ranges from $30 to $75 depending on the claim amount. California small claims court allows claims up to $12,500 for individuals.</p>
                    <p>Prepare to present your evidence at the hearing and explain why the deductions were improper or why the landlord failed to comply with the 21-day deadline.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Generally, no. California landlords cannot automatically deduct professional carpet cleaning costs from your security deposit unless the carpets are damaged beyond normal wear and tear. If you left the carpets in the same condition as when you moved in, minus normal wear, the landlord cannot charge for cleaning.</p>
                    <p>However, if there are stains, pet damage, burns, or excessive soiling that goes beyond normal use, the landlord may deduct reasonable cleaning costs. Some landlords include lease clauses requiring professional carpet cleaning upon move-out, but California courts have found such clauses to be unenforceable if they require cleaning regardless of the carpet's condition.</p>
                    <p>Document the carpet's condition with photos at move-in and move-out to protect yourself against improper deductions.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>California Civil Code Section 1950.5 limits security deposits to two months' rent for unfurnished units and three months' rent for furnished units. As of July 1, 2024, under AB 12, the security deposit limit for most residential tenancies is reduced to just one month's rent, regardless of whether the unit is furnished or unfurnished.</p>
                    <p>There are exceptions for small landlords who own no more than two residential properties with no more than four units total. Military service members receive additional protections limiting deposits.</p>
                    <p>The deposit limit includes all refundable deposits, including last month's rent if collected as a deposit. Any amount collected above these limits can be recovered by the tenant, and the landlord may face penalties.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>No, you cannot unilaterally decide to use your security deposit as last month's rent unless your landlord explicitly agrees. While some landlords may accept this arrangement, you do not have the legal right to withhold rent and apply your deposit without permission.</p>
                    <p>If you fail to pay rent and claim your deposit should cover it, the landlord can pursue eviction for nonpayment of rent and potentially sue you for the unpaid amount. The security deposit serves a different legal purpose than rent payment - it secures the landlord against damages and unpaid obligations.</p>
                    <p>If you want to use your deposit toward final rent, negotiate this with your landlord in writing before your move-out date. Some landlords prefer this arrangement to avoid the 21-day return process.</p>
