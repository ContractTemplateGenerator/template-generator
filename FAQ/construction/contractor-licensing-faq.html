This threshold includes the value of all labor and materials provided, not just the contractor's fee. The license requirement applies to the full range of construction activities including general building, specialty trades like electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and roofing, and specific activities like tree service, landscaping, and swimming pool construction. There are limited exceptions to the licensing requirement. Property owners may perform work on their own primary residence without a license if they do the work themselves or use employees who are on payroll, though electrical and plumbing work may require permits and inspections. Handyman services under $500 per project do not require a license, but combining multiple small jobs to avoid the threshold is prohibited. Work performed by regular employees of a property owner on the owner's property may be exempt. The CSLB strictly enforces licensing requirements, and penalties for unlicensed contracting are significant."

            "text": "Hiring an unlicensed contractor in California creates significant risks for homeowners and provides fewer protections if problems arise. First, unlicensed contractors cannot legally file mechanics liens to enforce payment, but this also means there is no bond or license to file claims against if the contractor fails to perform. Unlicensed contractors are not subject to CSLB oversight, so you cannot file a CSLB complaint or access contractor bond remedies. If the unlicensed contractor's work causes injury or property damage, you may have difficulty recovering because they likely lack proper insurance. Your own homeowner's insurance may not cover work performed by unlicensed contractors. If you knowingly hire an unlicensed contractor, you may be aiding unlicensed practice, which can affect your legal position. Work performed without proper licensing may not meet code requirements and could fail inspection, requiring costly repairs. Under Business and Professions Code Section 7031, an unlicensed contractor cannot sue to collect payment for their work, which might seem like an advantage but often reflects underlying quality and reliability issues. Always verify a contractor's license status through the CSLB website before hiring, and be wary of contractors who ask to be paid in cash or avoid written contracts."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "No, under California Business and Professions Code Section 7031, a person who performs work as a contractor without a valid license at all times during the performance of the contract cannot bring or maintain any action to collect compensation for the work. This is one of the strongest contractor licensing enforcement provisions in the country and serves as a powerful defense for homeowners who hired unlicensed contractors. The court must apply Section 7031 even if the homeowner received the benefit of the work and even if the contractor substantially performed. The contractor's lack of license is a complete bar to recovery, regardless of the quality of work performed. However, there are nuances to this protection. If the contractor was properly licensed at the start but the license lapsed during the project, different rules may apply. The substantial compliance doctrine under Section 7031(e) allows limited recovery if the contractor was licensed during substantially all of the work and acted reasonably and in good faith. Additionally, even though the contractor cannot sue for the contract price, issues of unjust enrichment and quantum meruit may arise in complex cases, though courts generally enforce Section 7031 strictly to discourage unlicensed contracting."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Verifying a contractor's license in California is free and easy through the Contractors State License Board website or by calling the CSLB. The online license check tool allows you to search by license number, contractor name, or business name. The search results provide comprehensive information including the license number, business name and address, license classification showing what types of work the contractor is authorized to perform, license status such as active, inactive, suspended, or revoked, expiration date, workers' compensation insurance status, and the bonding company and bond amount. The CSLB website also shows any disciplinary actions, legal actions, or complaints against the contractor. You should verify that the license is active and in good standing, that the license classification covers the type of work you need, that workers' compensation insurance is current if the contractor has employees, and that the bond is current. Be cautious of contractors who cannot provide a license number, claim to be licensed under someone else's license, or have recently obtained their license after a period of suspension. Ask for the contractor's pocket license card, which they are required to carry, and compare it to the online records."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "California has three main categories of contractor licenses, each with specific classifications. Class A General Engineering Contractor licenses authorize work requiring specialized engineering knowledge and skill, including highways, tunnels, bridges, sewers, pipelines, and similar infrastructure projects. Class B General Building Contractor licenses authorize construction of structures including residential and commercial buildings. General contractors typically coordinate projects and may supervise subcontractors but must use properly licensed specialty contractors for certain work. Class C Specialty Contractor licenses cover 42 specific trade classifications for specialty work. Common C licenses include C-10 Electrical, C-36 Plumbing, C-20 HVAC, C-39 Roofing, C-33 Painting, C-27 Landscaping, C-61 Limited Specialty, and many others. Some specialty classifications have sub-categories with specific scopes. Contractors may hold multiple license classifications. The license type determines the scope of work a contractor is legally authorized to perform. Hiring a contractor without the proper classification for your project can create problems similar to hiring an unlicensed contractor. For example, a general building contractor cannot perform electrical work requiring a C-10 license without hiring a licensed electrical subcontractor. Always verify that the contractor's license classifications cover the specific work you need performed."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Unlicensed contracting is a criminal offense in California with escalating penalties for repeat offenses. Under Business and Professions Code Section 7028, a first conviction for unlicensed contracting is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $5,000, or imprisonment in county jail for up to six months, or both. For a second offense within five years, the fine increases to up to $5,000 and imprisonment can be up to one year. A third or subsequent offense within five years is punishable by a fine of $5,000 to $10,000 and 90 days to one year imprisonment. Additionally, under Section 7028.1, if the unlicensed work causes property damage or bodily injury, the offense can be charged as a felony punishable by one to three years in state prison and fines up to $10,000. Prosecutors may also pursue charges for theft, fraud, or elder abuse in appropriate cases. The CSLB actively investigates unlicensed contracting, often through sting operations. Beyond criminal penalties, unlicensed contractors face civil liability and are barred from collecting payment for their work. Homeowners who suspect they are dealing with an unlicensed contractor should report to the CSLB, which may investigate and refer cases for prosecution."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "California provides several avenues for recovering money from unlicensed contractors who perform defective work or fail to complete projects. First, you can sue the unlicensed contractor directly in civil court for breach of contract, fraud, or negligence. While the unlicensed contractor cannot counter-sue for payment under Business and Professions Code Section 7031, you retain all your normal legal remedies. For smaller claims, California small claims court handles cases up to $12,500 for individuals. You can file a complaint with the CSLB, which investigates unlicensed contractor activity and may refer cases for criminal prosecution. While the CSLB cannot directly order an unlicensed contractor to pay you, criminal prosecution may result in restitution orders. If the unlicensed contractor owns property or has assets in California, a civil judgment can be collected through wage garnishment, bank levies, or property liens. For fraud cases, you may be able to recover not just actual damages but also punitive damages if the contractor's conduct was particularly egregious. If you paid by credit card, you may be able to dispute the charges with your credit card company. Document all evidence of the contractor's unlicensed status, the agreement, payments made, and work performed or not performed."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "California requires licensed contractors to maintain specific insurance and bonding, though requirements vary based on whether the contractor has employees. All licensed contractors must maintain a contractor's license bond of at least $25,000 under Business and Professions Code Section 7071.6. This bond protects homeowners and others who are damaged by contractor violations. The bond amount increases for some contractors based on disciplinary history. Contractors with employees must maintain workers' compensation insurance covering job-related injuries. The CSLB verifies workers' compensation coverage and contractors without employees must file a certificate of exemption. Contractors who are exempt from workers' compensation requirements must file Form 4002 with the CSLB. While not required by state law, many contractors also carry general liability insurance, which covers property damage and bodily injury caused by the contractor's work, and commercial auto insurance for work vehicles. Some homeowners' associations and commercial property owners require contractors to carry specific liability limits. Before hiring a contractor, verify their bond status and workers' compensation coverage through the CSLB website, and request proof of liability insurance directly from the contractor. Certificates of insurance should name you as an additional insured for your project."

            "text": "If a contractor's license expires during your project, it creates legal complications similar to unlicensed contracting, though some protections exist for contractors who substantially comply with licensing requirements. Under Business and Professions Code Section 7031(e), a contractor who was properly licensed when the contract was executed may recover compensation for work performed during periods when they were properly licensed if they were licensed at all times during substantially all of the performance, their failure to hold a license was due to inadvertence or excusable neglect, and they acted reasonably and in good faith. However, this substantial compliance doctrine is narrowly applied, and work performed during the unlicensed period may not be compensable. From the homeowner's perspective, you should monitor your contractor's license status throughout the project using the CSLB website. If you discover the license has expired, notify the contractor in writing immediately and request proof of license reinstatement before work continues. Work performed while the contractor is unlicensed may not be covered by insurance or the contractor's bond. You may have grounds to terminate the contract if the contractor cannot promptly restore their license, and you should withhold payment for any work performed during the unlicensed period."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "California allows property owners to act as their own contractor on their primary residence without a contractor's license under the owner-builder exemption. To use this exemption, you must own the property, the property must be your principal residence, you must either perform the work yourself or supervise construction using employees on your payroll, and you must not build more than one structure per year. There are important limitations to this exemption. If you sell the property within one year of completion, you may face liability for any defects and may be required to disclose that you acted as owner-builder. You cannot use the exemption repeatedly to build and sell homes. For certain work, particularly electrical, plumbing, and HVAC, permits and inspections are still required, and you may need to use licensed subcontractors. The owner-builder exemption does not relieve you of responsibility for obtaining proper permits, following building codes, and ensuring work meets safety standards. Workers' compensation requirements may still apply if you have employees. Building permits applied for under the owner-builder exemption require signing a disclosure about the limitations of the exemption and the homeowner's responsibilities. Many homeowners underestimate the complexity of acting as their own general contractor."

                    <p>No, under California Business and Professions Code Section 7031, a person who performs work as a contractor without a valid license at all times during the performance of the contract cannot bring or maintain any action to collect compensation for the work. This is one of the strongest contractor licensing enforcement provisions in the country and serves as a powerful defense for homeowners who hired unlicensed contractors.</p>
                    <p>The court must apply Section 7031 even if the homeowner received the benefit of the work and even if the contractor substantially performed. The contractor's lack of license is a complete bar to recovery. However, if the contractor was properly licensed at the start but the license lapsed during the project, the substantial compliance doctrine under Section 7031(e) may allow limited recovery in some circumstances.</p>

                    <p>Verifying a contractor's license in California is free and easy through the Contractors State License Board website or by calling the CSLB. The online license check tool allows you to search by license number, contractor name, or business name. The search results provide comprehensive information including the license number, business name and address, license classification, license status, expiration date, workers' compensation insurance status, and bonding company information.</p>
                    <p>The CSLB website also shows any disciplinary actions, legal actions, or complaints against the contractor. Verify that the license is active and in good standing, that the license classification covers the type of work you need, and that workers' compensation insurance is current if the contractor has employees. Ask for the contractor's pocket license card and compare it to the online records.</p>

                    <p>California has three main categories of contractor licenses, each with specific classifications. Class A General Engineering Contractor licenses authorize work requiring specialized engineering knowledge and skill, including highways, tunnels, bridges, sewers, and pipelines. Class B General Building Contractor licenses authorize construction of structures including residential and commercial buildings.</p>
                    <p>Class C Specialty Contractor licenses cover 42 specific trade classifications for specialty work. Common C licenses include C-10 Electrical, C-36 Plumbing, C-20 HVAC, C-39 Roofing, C-33 Painting, C-27 Landscaping, and many others. The license type determines the scope of work a contractor is legally authorized to perform. Hiring a contractor without the proper classification for your project can create problems similar to hiring an unlicensed contractor.</p>

                    <p>Unlicensed contracting is a criminal offense in California with escalating penalties for repeat offenses. Under Business and Professions Code Section 7028, a first conviction is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $5,000, or imprisonment in county jail for up to six months, or both. For a second offense within five years, the fine increases to up to $5,000 and imprisonment can be up to one year.</p>
                    <p>A third or subsequent offense within five years is punishable by a fine of $5,000 to $10,000 and 90 days to one year imprisonment. Under Section 7028.1, if the unlicensed work causes property damage or bodily injury, the offense can be charged as a felony punishable by one to three years in state prison and fines up to $10,000. Prosecutors may also pursue charges for theft, fraud, or elder abuse in appropriate cases.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>California provides several avenues for recovering money from unlicensed contractors who perform defective work or fail to complete projects. You can sue the unlicensed contractor directly in civil court for breach of contract, fraud, or negligence. While the unlicensed contractor cannot counter-sue for payment under Business and Professions Code Section 7031, you retain all your normal legal remedies.</p>
                    <p>For smaller claims, California small claims court handles cases up to $12,500 for individuals. You can file a complaint with the CSLB, which investigates unlicensed contractor activity and may refer cases for criminal prosecution. If you paid by credit card, you may be able to dispute the charges with your credit card company. Document all evidence of the contractor's unlicensed status, the agreement, payments made, and work performed.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>California requires licensed contractors to maintain specific insurance and bonding, though requirements vary based on whether the contractor has employees. All licensed contractors must maintain a contractor's license bond of at least $25,000 under Business and Professions Code Section 7071.6. This bond protects homeowners and others who are damaged by contractor violations.</p>
                    <p>Contractors with employees must maintain workers' compensation insurance covering job-related injuries. Contractors without employees must file a certificate of exemption. While not required by state law, many contractors also carry general liability insurance. Before hiring a contractor, verify their bond status and workers' compensation coverage through the CSLB website, and request proof of liability insurance directly from the contractor.</p>

                    <p>If a contractor's license expires during your project, it creates legal complications similar to unlicensed contracting. Under Business and Professions Code Section 7031(e), a contractor who was properly licensed when the contract was executed may recover compensation for work performed during periods when they were properly licensed if they substantially complied with licensing requirements and their failure to hold a license was due to inadvertence or excusable neglect.</p>
                    <p>Monitor your contractor's license status throughout the project using the CSLB website. If you discover the license has expired, notify the contractor in writing immediately and request proof of license reinstatement before work continues. Work performed while the contractor is unlicensed may not be covered by insurance or the contractor's bond. You may have grounds to terminate the contract if the contractor cannot promptly restore their license.</p>

                    <p>California allows property owners to act as their own contractor on their primary residence without a contractor's license under the owner-builder exemption. To use this exemption, you must own the property, the property must be your principal residence, you must either perform the work yourself or supervise construction using employees on your payroll, and you must not build more than one structure per year.</p>
                    <p>If you sell the property within one year of completion, you may face liability for any defects and must disclose that you acted as owner-builder. For certain work, particularly electrical, plumbing, and HVAC, permits and inspections are still required. The owner-builder exemption does not relieve you of responsibility for obtaining proper permits, following building codes, and ensuring work meets safety standards.</p>
