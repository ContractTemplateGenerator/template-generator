File Form SC-100 in the county where the accident occurred or where the defendant lives.

A car with accident history is typically worth less than one without, regardless of repair quality. To prove diminished value, obtain a pre-accident valuation using resources like Kelley Blue Book or NADA guides, get a post-repair appraisal from a licensed appraiser who documents the diminished value, calculate the difference as your diminished value claim, and gather comparable sales data showing similar vehicles without accident history sell for more. Some auto appraisers specialize in diminished value assessments and can provide expert reports. The amount recoverable depends on factors including the vehicle's age, mileage, severity of damage, quality of repairs, and local market conditions. Newer vehicles with lower mileage typically have higher diminished value claims. Include diminished value as a separate line item in your small claims damages, supported by appraisal documentation."

Essential evidence includes photographs of all vehicles involved showing damage, the accident scene including road conditions and traffic signs, skid marks and debris, and any visible injuries. Also gather the police report or CHP traffic collision report if available, repair estimates from at least two licensed body shops, actual repair invoices if work was completed, rental car receipts for substitute transportation, towing and storage receipts, medical records if claiming injury damages, witness statements with contact information, and diagrams of how the accident occurred. Insurance documentation is also valuable including correspondence with your insurer and the other party's insurer, the claims denial letter if applicable, and records of any payments received. Dashcam footage if available can be powerful evidence. Organize everything chronologically, label each exhibit, and prepare copies for the judge and defendant. The more thorough your documentation, the stronger your case."

            "text": "California follows a pure comparative negligence system, meaning fault can be divided among multiple parties and you can recover damages even if you were partially at fault. Your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. For example, if you suffered $10,000 in damages but were 20% at fault, you can recover $8,000. Evidence used to determine fault includes the police report and officer's observations, witness statements about what each driver did, physical evidence like skid marks and vehicle damage locations, traffic citations issued at the scene, photographs of the scene showing traffic controls, and expert accident reconstruction if needed. Common factors indicating fault include traffic violations (running red lights, speeding, illegal turns), following too closely (rear-end collisions usually fault the following driver), failure to yield right-of-way, distracted or impaired driving, and unsafe lane changes. In small claims court, the judge will assess the evidence and assign fault percentages when determining your recovery amount."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Whether you can sue after receiving an insurance payment depends on what you signed and what damages remain uncompensated. If you signed a full release of all claims when accepting the insurance payment, you likely cannot sue for additional amounts related to that accident. Carefully review any documents you signed. However, you may be able to sue if you only released claims against the insurance company but not the individual driver, your release covered only property damage but you have additional injury claims, you have damages not covered by the payment such as diminished value or your deductible, or you didn't sign a full release. If the insurance only partially covered your damages and you didn't release all claims, you can sue the at-fault driver for the difference. Common uncompensated damages include your insurance deductible amount, rental car costs exceeding coverage limits, diminished value not covered by insurance, and out-of-pocket expenses not reimbursed. Review your settlement documents carefully before filing."

Your insurance deductible is a legitimate damage caused by the other driver's negligence. To recover your deductible, gather evidence proving the other driver was at fault for the accident, document that you paid the deductible with receipts or bank statements, obtain a letter from your insurance company confirming the deductible amount and that it wasn't reimbursed, and file your small claims case against the at-fault driver. You don't need to sue the other driver's insurance company; sue the driver directly. Even if insurance covered most of your repair costs, you're entitled to be made whole, which includes deductible recovery. Your insurance company may also be pursuing subrogation against the at-fault driver for amounts it paid; coordinate to avoid duplicating claims. If your insurer successfully subrogate, they should reimburse your deductible from amounts recovered."

            "text": "When a car is totaled (repair costs exceed the vehicle's value), California law entitles you to the fair market value of your vehicle immediately before the accident, not the cost to repair it. To calculate and prove fair market value, research comparable vehicles of the same year, make, model, mileage, and condition using Kelley Blue Book, NADA guides, and local classified listings. Document your vehicle's specific features including trim level, options, recent maintenance, new tires, or upgrades that increase value. Obtain a professional appraisal if the amount is significant. Your damages include the fair market value of the totaled vehicle, minus any salvage value if you kept the car, plus sales tax you'll pay on a replacement vehicle, registration transfer fees, towing and storage costs, and rental car expenses while obtaining a replacement. If the insurance company's total loss valuation seems low, challenge it with your own research and comparable sales data. You can sue for the difference between what insurance paid and actual fair market value."

The at-fault driver is responsible for putting you in the position you would have been in without the accident, which includes providing substitute transportation. Recoverable rental expenses include the daily rental rate for a comparable vehicle (not necessarily identical, but reasonable), the rental period limited to a reasonable repair time plus time needed to choose a shop, and related costs like fuel if required by the rental agreement. However, you have a duty to mitigate damages, meaning you should choose a reasonably priced rental and not delay repairs unnecessarily. Bring rental receipts showing dates, daily rates, and total cost, repair shop estimates showing expected repair duration, and evidence of when you dropped off and picked up your vehicle. If repairs took longer than expected due to parts delays or shop scheduling, document those reasons. Courts generally award rental costs for the reasonable time needed for repairs."

            "text": "Suing a hit-and-run driver who damaged your parked car requires first identifying them. If you have their information, filing a small claims case is straightforward. To identify an unknown hit-and-run driver, file a police report immediately as this creates an official record and police may investigate, check for witnesses who may have seen the incident or recorded license plates, look for nearby security cameras at businesses, parking garages, or residential buildings, post on neighborhood social media groups asking if anyone witnessed the incident, and check your own dashcam if you have one with parking mode. Once identified, gather evidence of the damage and their responsibility. If you cannot identify the driver, you may need to rely on your own uninsured motorist property damage coverage or collision coverage and pay your deductible. If identified later, you can sue to recover your deductible and any uncompensated damages. California Vehicle Code Section 20002 makes hit-and-run of parked vehicles a crime, and the police report may help locate the responsible party."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Deciding between using insurance and suing in small claims court depends on several factors. Consider using insurance when you have collision coverage and want faster resolution, the damage is significant and you need quick repairs, the at-fault driver is uninsured or underinsured, or you're uncertain about proving fault. Consider small claims court when the damage is less than your deductible making insurance claims impractical, you want to avoid potential premium increases from filing a claim, the insurance company offers less than your actual damages, you want to recover damages insurance doesn't cover like diminished value, or the at-fault driver is clearly liable and has assets to pay. You can also use both approaches: file with your insurance for immediate repairs, then sue in small claims to recover your deductible and uncovered damages. Your insurance company may also pursue subrogation against the at-fault driver. Consider the time, effort, and stress of litigation versus the convenience of an insurance claim when making your decision."

                    <span>Q: How is fault determined in a California car accident case?</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>California follows a pure comparative negligence system, meaning fault can be divided among multiple parties and you can recover damages even if you were partially at fault. Your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. For example, if you suffered $10,000 in damages but were 20% at fault, you can recover $8,000.</p>
                    <p>Evidence used to determine fault includes police reports, witness statements, physical evidence like skid marks and vehicle damage locations, traffic citations issued at the scene, photographs, and expert accident reconstruction. Common factors indicating fault include traffic violations, following too closely, failure to yield, distracted driving, and unsafe lane changes. In small claims court, the judge will assess the evidence and assign fault percentages.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Whether you can sue after receiving an insurance payment depends on what you signed and what damages remain uncompensated. If you signed a full release of all claims when accepting the insurance payment, you likely cannot sue for additional amounts related to that accident. Carefully review any documents you signed.</p>
                    <p>However, you may be able to sue if you only released claims against the insurance company (not the individual driver), your release covered only property damage but you have additional injury claims, you have damages not covered by the payment (such as diminished value or your deductible), or you didn't sign a full release. Review your settlement documents carefully before filing suit.</p>

                    <p>If you paid a deductible to have your car repaired under your own collision coverage, you can sue the at-fault driver in small claims court to recover that amount. Your insurance deductible is a legitimate damage caused by the other driver's negligence.</p>
                    <p>To recover your deductible, gather evidence proving the other driver was at fault, document that you paid the deductible with receipts or bank statements, obtain a letter from your insurance company confirming the deductible amount, and file your small claims case against the at-fault driver directly. Your insurance company may also be pursuing subrogation; coordinate to avoid duplicating claims. If your insurer successfully subrogates, they should reimburse your deductible from amounts recovered.</p>

                    <p>When a car is totaled (repair costs exceed the vehicle's value), California law entitles you to the fair market value of your vehicle immediately before the accident, not the cost to repair it. To calculate fair market value:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Research comparable vehicles using Kelley Blue Book, NADA guides, and local listings</li>
                        <li>Document your vehicle's specific features and condition</li>
                        <li>Obtain a professional appraisal if the amount is significant</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your total damages include fair market value (minus salvage if you kept the car), sales tax on a replacement vehicle, registration transfer fees, towing and storage costs, and rental car expenses. If the insurance valuation seems low, challenge it with your own research and comparable sales data.</p>

                    <p>Yes, you can recover reasonable rental car costs in California small claims court as part of your accident damages. The at-fault driver is responsible for providing substitute transportation. Recoverable rental expenses include the daily rental rate for a comparable vehicle, the rental period limited to reasonable repair time, and related costs like fuel charges.</p>
                    <p>However, you have a duty to mitigate damages, meaning you should choose a reasonably priced rental and not delay repairs unnecessarily. Bring rental receipts showing dates, daily rates, and total cost, repair shop estimates showing expected repair duration, and evidence of when you dropped off and picked up your vehicle. Courts generally award rental costs for the reasonable time needed for repairs.</p>

                    <p>Suing a hit-and-run driver who damaged your parked car requires first identifying them. To identify an unknown hit-and-run driver:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>File a police report immediately - police may investigate</li>
                        <li>Check for witnesses who may have seen the incident</li>
                        <li>Look for nearby security cameras at businesses or residences</li>
                        <li>Post on neighborhood social media groups</li>
                        <li>Check your own dashcam if you have parking mode</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once identified, gather evidence of the damage and their responsibility. If you cannot identify the driver, you may need to rely on your own uninsured motorist property damage coverage or collision coverage. If identified later, you can sue to recover your deductible and any uncompensated damages.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Deciding between insurance and small claims court depends on several factors. Consider using insurance when you have collision coverage and want faster resolution, the damage is significant, the at-fault driver is uninsured, or you're uncertain about proving fault.</p>
                    <p>Consider small claims court when the damage is less than your deductible, you want to avoid potential premium increases, insurance offers less than actual damages, you want to recover damages insurance doesn't cover (like diminished value), or the at-fault driver is clearly liable. You can use both approaches: file with insurance for immediate repairs, then sue to recover your deductible and uncovered damages. Consider the time and effort of litigation versus the convenience of insurance claims.</p>
