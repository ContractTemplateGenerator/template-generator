Individual plaintiffs can sue for up to $12,500, while businesses, partnerships, corporations, and other entities are limited to $6,250. This limit applies to the total amount you're seeking, including any damages, fees, or costs you're requesting. If your claim exceeds these limits, you have three options: you can waive the amount over the limit and sue in small claims court, file your case in regular civil court where higher amounts are permitted, or split your claim into separate causes of action if they are truly distinct claims. However, you cannot artificially split a single claim to stay within small claims limits, as courts will dismiss such attempts as abuse of process."

This waiver is permanent and binding - you cannot later sue for the waived amount in another court. This strategy makes sense when the benefits of small claims court outweigh the loss, such as faster resolution, lower costs, simpler procedures, and the ability to represent yourself without an attorney. However, you should carefully calculate whether the time and expense of regular civil court litigation might be justified if your claim significantly exceeds small claims limits.

This limitation applies to the calendar year, not a rolling 12-month period. The restriction prevents businesses from using small claims court as a routine collection mechanism while still allowing individuals with legitimate larger claims to access the court.

Additionally, some specialized statutes require cases be heard in other courts, such as certain employment discrimination claims. If your case involves both monetary damages and non-monetary relief, you may need to file in regular civil court or separate the issues.

Pain and suffering falls under non-economic damages, which compensate for physical discomfort, emotional distress, anxiety, loss of enjoyment of life, and other subjective harms resulting from an injury. In small claims court, you'll need to present evidence supporting your pain and suffering claim, such as medical records documenting your injuries, photographs showing the injury progression, testimony about how the injury affected your daily activities, and documentation of any treatment for emotional distress. Without a jury, the judge will determine a reasonable amount based on the evidence presented. Be prepared to explain specifically how the injury impacted your life, as judges appreciate concrete examples over vague claims of suffering."

While individuals can sue for up to $12,500, corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, and other business entities are limited to $6,250 per case. This distinction exists because the legislature intended small claims court primarily for individual citizens with modest claims, not as a collection tool for businesses. Additionally, businesses face the same annual filing restrictions as individuals: unlimited cases up to $2,500, but only two cases over $2,500 per calendar year. A business suing in small claims court must appear through a regular employee, officer, or director who can bind the business - they cannot send a hired attorney or outside representative. If your business regularly has claims exceeding $6,250, you may need to pursue those in regular civil court, potentially requiring attorney representation and more complex procedures."

However, there are limited exceptions. If your contract with the defendant includes an attorney fee provision, and you incurred attorney fees before the small claims case (such as for demand letter preparation or legal consultation), you may be able to include those pre-hearing fees as part of your damages. Similarly, certain California statutes provide for attorney fee recovery regardless of court type, such as claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act or Civil Code Section 1942.4 for habitability violations. If you're entitled to statutory attorney fees and hired an attorney for pre-filing work, include those amounts in your claim. Be prepared to provide documentation of the fees incurred and the legal basis for recovery. Remember that total claim including any fees must still fall within small claims limits."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "If your damages increase after filing but before your hearing, you have several options depending on the new total amount. You can file an amendment to your claim using Form SC-104 to reflect the higher damages, provided the new total remains within small claims jurisdictional limits. If the increased damages push your claim over the small claims limit, you must decide whether to waive the excess and proceed in small claims court, or dismiss your small claims case and refile in regular civil court. You cannot collect damages that weren't part of your original or amended claim, so it's crucial to update your case before the hearing. If damages increase after judgment, you generally cannot seek additional compensation for that claim. For ongoing damages, such as continuing medical treatment, you may need to wait until treatment concludes or file a civil court case where you can request future damages. Consider postponing your hearing if you expect damages to continue increasing."

            "text": "California small claims court handles claims for the value of personal property rather than ordering the return of specific items. If someone has your property and won't return it, you sue for the fair market value of the property at the time it was taken or damaged. The court will award money damages rather than ordering the defendant to return the item itself (which would be specific performance or replevin). To prove your claim, you'll need evidence of ownership such as receipts, photographs, or registration documents, along with proof of the property's value through appraisals, comparable sales, or original purchase receipts minus depreciation. If the property has sentimental value exceeding its market value, the court will generally only award fair market value. For unique items like artwork or antiques, obtain a professional appraisal before filing. Remember that even if you win a judgment, you'll receive money, not the property itself, unless the defendant voluntarily agrees to return it."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "California allows recovery of interest on small claims judgments in several ways. Pre-judgment interest may be recoverable if your claim is based on a contract that specifies an interest rate, or on a sum certain (a specific, fixed amount) that was due on a particular date. The rate for contract claims defaults to 10% per year unless a different rate is specified in the contract. For non-contract claims like personal injury or property damage, pre-judgment interest typically isn't available. Post-judgment interest accrues automatically on all money judgments at the rate of 10% per year from the date of judgment until paid. When calculating your claim, include any applicable pre-judgment interest in your total. For example, if someone owed you $5,000 under a contract and didn't pay for two years, you could include $1,000 in pre-judgment interest. Keep your total within small claims limits. The judgment will state the interest rate, and interest continues accruing until the defendant pays in full."

                    <p>California small claims court has jurisdiction only over money damages and cannot handle certain case types. Excluded matters include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Requests for injunctive relief ordering someone to do or stop doing something</li>
                        <li>Defamation claims seeking damages over $12,500</li>
                        <li>Divorce or family law matters</li>
                        <li>Guardianship or conservatorship cases</li>

                        <li>Actions for specific performance of contracts</li>
                        <li>Unlawful detainer (eviction) actions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If your case involves both monetary damages and non-monetary relief, you may need to file in regular civil court or separate the issues. Small claims court also cannot hear appeals from other courts or administrative agencies.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, you can sue for pain and suffering damages in California small claims court, but your total claim including all damages must stay within the jurisdictional limit. Pain and suffering falls under non-economic damages, which compensate for physical discomfort, emotional distress, anxiety, loss of enjoyment of life, and other subjective harms resulting from an injury.</p>
                    <p>In small claims court, you'll need to present evidence supporting your pain and suffering claim, such as medical records documenting your injuries, photographs showing the injury progression, testimony about how the injury affected your daily activities, and documentation of any treatment for emotional distress. Without a jury, the judge will determine a reasonable amount based on the evidence presented. Be prepared to explain specifically how the injury impacted your life, as judges appreciate concrete examples over vague claims of suffering.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, California imposes a lower monetary limit on businesses filing in small claims court. While individuals can sue for up to $12,500, corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, and other business entities are limited to $6,250 per case. This distinction exists because the legislature intended small claims court primarily for individual citizens with modest claims, not as a collection tool for businesses.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, businesses face the same annual filing restrictions as individuals: unlimited cases up to $2,500, but only two cases over $2,500 per calendar year. A business suing in small claims court must appear through a regular employee, officer, or director who can bind the business - they cannot send a hired attorney or outside representative. If your business regularly has claims exceeding $6,250, you may need to pursue those in regular civil court.</p>

                    <span>Q: Can I recover attorney fees in California small claims court?</span>
                    <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Generally, attorney fees are not recoverable in California small claims court because attorneys are not permitted to represent parties at the small claims hearing. However, there are limited exceptions. If your contract with the defendant includes an attorney fee provision, and you incurred attorney fees before the small claims case (such as for demand letter preparation or legal consultation), you may be able to include those pre-hearing fees as part of your damages.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, certain California statutes provide for attorney fee recovery regardless of court type, such as claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act or Civil Code Section 1942.4 for habitability violations. If you're entitled to statutory attorney fees and hired an attorney for pre-filing work, include those amounts in your claim. Be prepared to provide documentation of the fees incurred and the legal basis for recovery. Remember that total claim including any fees must still fall within small claims limits.</p>

                    <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>If your damages increase after filing but before your hearing, you have several options depending on the new total amount. You can file an amendment to your claim using Form SC-104 to reflect the higher damages, provided the new total remains within small claims jurisdictional limits. If the increased damages push your claim over the small claims limit, you must decide whether to waive the excess and proceed in small claims court, or dismiss your small claims case and refile in regular civil court.</p>
                    <p>You cannot collect damages that weren't part of your original or amended claim, so it's crucial to update your case before the hearing. If damages increase after judgment, you generally cannot seek additional compensation for that claim. For ongoing damages, such as continuing medical treatment, you may need to wait until treatment concludes or file a civil court case where you can request future damages. Consider postponing your hearing if you expect damages to continue increasing.</p>

                    <span>Q: Can I sue for the return of property in California small claims court?</span>
                    <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>California small claims court handles claims for the value of personal property rather than ordering the return of specific items. If someone has your property and won't return it, you sue for the fair market value of the property at the time it was taken or damaged. The court will award money damages rather than ordering the defendant to return the item itself (which would be specific performance or replevin).</p>
                    <p>To prove your claim, you'll need evidence of ownership such as receipts, photographs, or registration documents, along with proof of the property's value through appraisals, comparable sales, or original purchase receipts minus depreciation. If the property has sentimental value exceeding its market value, the court will generally only award fair market value. For unique items like artwork or antiques, obtain a professional appraisal before filing. Remember that even if you win a judgment, you'll receive money, not the property itself.</p>

                    <span>Q: What interest can I recover on my California small claims judgment?</span>
                    <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>California allows recovery of interest on small claims judgments in several ways. Pre-judgment interest may be recoverable if your claim is based on a contract that specifies an interest rate, or on a sum certain (a specific, fixed amount) that was due on a particular date. The rate for contract claims defaults to 10% per year unless a different rate is specified in the contract.</p>
                    <p>For non-contract claims like personal injury or property damage, pre-judgment interest typically isn't available. Post-judgment interest accrues automatically on all money judgments at the rate of 10% per year from the date of judgment until paid. When calculating your claim, include any applicable pre-judgment interest in your total. For example, if someone owed you $5,000 under a contract and didn't pay for two years, you could include $1,000 in pre-judgment interest. Keep your total within small claims limits.</p>
