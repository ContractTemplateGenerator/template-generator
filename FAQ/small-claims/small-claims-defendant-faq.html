If you have a claim against the plaintiff arising from the same transaction or occurrence, file a Defendant's Claim (Form SC-120) before the hearing; this form must be served on the plaintiff at least 5 days before the hearing. You may also file a challenge to venue if you believe the plaintiff filed in the wrong court, or challenge the amount if it exceeds small claims limits.

Common defenses include statute of limitations, arguing the plaintiff waited too long to sue; payment, proving you already paid the amount claimed; lack of contract formation, showing no valid agreement existed; breach by plaintiff, demonstrating the plaintiff failed to perform their obligations first; improper service, challenging that you weren't properly notified of the lawsuit; wrong defendant, showing the plaintiff sued the wrong person or entity; accord and satisfaction, proving the debt was settled for less; fraud or misrepresentation by the plaintiff; duress or undue influence in contract formation; impossibility or impracticability of performance; failure to mitigate damages by the plaintiff; and comparative fault, showing the plaintiff contributed to their own damages. Choose defenses that apply to your specific facts and be prepared to present evidence supporting each one. The judge will consider all defenses raised when making a decision."

To do so, complete Form SC-120 (Defendant's Claim and ORDER to Go to Small Claims Court) and file it with the court clerk before your hearing. You must serve a copy on the plaintiff at least 5 days before the hearing date. Your claim must be within the small claims dollar limits: up to $12,500 for individuals or $6,250 for businesses. Your counterclaim should ideally arise from the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiff's claim, though it doesn't have to. For example, if you're being sued for payment under a contract, your counterclaim might be for defective work performed under that same contract. If your counterclaim is successful, it may offset or exceed the plaintiff's claim, resulting in a judgment in your favor. There is a filing fee for defendant's claims similar to plaintiff filing fees. Filing a counterclaim ensures both disputes are resolved in one proceeding."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Attempting settlement before your California small claims hearing is often a wise strategy. Contact the plaintiff to discuss resolution, as many disputes can be resolved more quickly and cheaply through negotiation than litigation. Consider the strengths and weaknesses of both sides' positions when evaluating settlement offers. Even if you believe you have strong defenses, litigation involves uncertainty, time, and stress. Settlement provides certainty and closure. If you reach an agreement, put it in writing immediately, specifying the amount, payment terms, and that the plaintiff will dismiss the case upon payment. If you agree to an installment payment plan, include consequences for missed payments. You can settle at any time before the judge announces a decision, including on the courthouse steps or during mediation offered by many courts. Be realistic about your chances of winning completely versus settling for a reduced amount. If you cannot reach a settlement, you've lost nothing and can still present your full defense at trial."

            "text": "If you fail to appear at your California small claims hearing, the court will likely enter a default judgment against you for the amount the plaintiff proves they're owed. The plaintiff must still present their case and evidence, and the judge will only award amounts properly supported, but without your presence to challenge the evidence, the plaintiff's version of events goes uncontested. A default judgment becomes a legal obligation you must pay, and the plaintiff can use collection methods including wage garnishment, bank levies, and property liens to collect. The judgment will also appear on your credit report, damaging your credit score for years. If you had a valid reason for missing the hearing, you can file a motion to vacate the default judgment within 30 days using Form SC-135. You'll need to show good cause for your absence, such as never receiving proper notice or experiencing a medical emergency. Simply forgetting or having schedule conflicts typically won't qualify as good cause."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes, defendants can request a postponement of their California small claims hearing by filing Form SC-150 (Request to Postpone Small Claims Hearing). Submit this request as early as possible, ideally at least 10 days before the scheduled hearing. Valid reasons for postponement include medical emergencies or serious illness, previously scheduled unavoidable conflicts like work travel, need for additional time to gather evidence or locate witnesses, recent receipt of the court papers leaving insufficient preparation time, and unavailability of essential witnesses. The court has discretion to grant or deny postponement requests based on the reasons provided. If the plaintiff opposes your request, the judge will consider both positions. Generally, each party is allowed one postponement, and courts are less likely to grant repeated requests. If your postponement is denied, you must appear at the original hearing date or risk a default judgment. In true emergencies on the hearing day, contact the court immediately by phone to explain your situation."

Essential evidence typically includes your copy of any contracts or agreements to compare with the plaintiff's version, proof of payments you've already made such as receipts, canceled checks, and bank statements, correspondence showing the plaintiff's admissions, agreements to modifications, or unreasonable demands, photographs documenting conditions, quality of work, or damage, written estimates or expert opinions contradicting the plaintiff's damage claims, witnesses who can testify about relevant facts, and a timeline of events with supporting documentation. Organize your evidence chronologically and prepare an outline connecting each piece to specific defenses. Bring three copies of everything: one for you, one for the judge, and one for the plaintiff. Anticipate what evidence the plaintiff might present and prepare responses. If a witness cannot attend, obtain a written declaration signed under penalty of perjury. The better organized your evidence, the more credible your defense will appear."

File a motion to transfer venue as soon as possible after receiving the court papers, ideally before the hearing. Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 116.370, proper venue is generally where the defendant resides, where a business defendant has its principal place of business, where the contract was entered or to be performed, or where injury or damage occurred. If the plaintiff filed in a court that doesn't fit any proper venue category for your case, you have grounds for transfer. However, if you fail to object to venue before or at the hearing, you may waive your right to challenge it. The burden is on you as defendant to prove improper venue. If your motion is granted, the case will be transferred to the appropriate court and a new hearing date set. This delays proceedings but ensures you're defending in a convenient location."

You have the right to appear and present your defense, including bringing evidence and witnesses to support your position. You have the right to cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses and challenge their evidence. You have the right to file a defendant's claim (counterclaim) against the plaintiff. You have the right to request a postponement for good cause. You have the right to appeal if you lose, seeking a new trial in Superior Court. You have the right to consult with an attorney before the hearing, even though attorneys generally cannot represent parties at the hearing. You have the right to request a small claims advisor's assistance for free at most courthouses. Understanding and exercising these rights gives you the best chance of a fair outcome."

                    <p>Yes, California allows defendants to file a Defendant's Claim (counterclaim) against the plaintiff in small claims court. To do so, complete Form SC-120 (Defendant's Claim and ORDER to Go to Small Claims Court) and file it with the court clerk before your hearing. You must serve a copy on the plaintiff at least 5 days before the hearing date.</p>
                    <p>Your claim must be within the small claims dollar limits: up to $12,500 for individuals or $6,250 for businesses. Your counterclaim should ideally arise from the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiff's claim, though it doesn't have to. If your counterclaim is successful, it may offset or exceed the plaintiff's claim, resulting in a judgment in your favor. There is a filing fee for defendant's claims similar to plaintiff filing fees.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Attempting settlement before your California small claims hearing is often a wise strategy. Contact the plaintiff to discuss resolution, as many disputes can be resolved more quickly and cheaply through negotiation than litigation. Consider the strengths and weaknesses of both sides' positions when evaluating settlement offers. Even if you believe you have strong defenses, litigation involves uncertainty, time, and stress.</p>
                    <p>If you reach an agreement, put it in writing immediately, specifying the amount, payment terms, and that the plaintiff will dismiss the case upon payment. If you agree to an installment payment plan, include consequences for missed payments. You can settle at any time before the judge announces a decision. Be realistic about your chances of winning completely versus settling for a reduced amount.</p>

                    <p>If you fail to appear at your California small claims hearing, the court will likely enter a default judgment against you for the amount the plaintiff proves they're owed. The plaintiff must still present their case and evidence, but without your presence to challenge the evidence, the plaintiff's version of events goes uncontested.</p>
                    <p>A default judgment becomes a legal obligation you must pay, and the plaintiff can use collection methods including wage garnishment, bank levies, and property liens. The judgment will also appear on your credit report, damaging your credit score for years. If you had a valid reason for missing the hearing, you can file a motion to vacate the default judgment within 30 days using Form SC-135. You'll need to show good cause for your absence, such as never receiving proper notice or experiencing a medical emergency.</p>

                    <p>Yes, defendants can request a postponement of their California small claims hearing by filing Form SC-150 (Request to Postpone Small Claims Hearing). Submit this request as early as possible, ideally at least 10 days before the scheduled hearing. Valid reasons for postponement include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Medical emergencies or serious illness</li>

                    <p>You can request a transfer of venue if the plaintiff filed the case in an improper location under California's venue rules. File a motion to transfer venue as soon as possible after receiving the court papers, ideally before the hearing. Under venue rules, proper venue is generally where the defendant resides, where a business defendant has its principal place of business, where the contract was entered or to be performed, or where injury or damage occurred.</p>
                    <p>If the plaintiff filed in a court that doesn't fit any proper venue category for your case, you have grounds for transfer. However, if you fail to object to venue before or at the hearing, you may waive your right to challenge it. The burden is on you as defendant to prove improper venue. If your motion is granted, the case will be transferred to the appropriate court and a new hearing date set.</p>
