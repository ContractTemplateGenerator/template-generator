If the 30th day falls on a weekend or court holiday, the deadline extends to the next court business day. To appeal, file Form SC-140 (Notice of Appeal) with the small claims clerk along with the required filing fee. Make sure to file early enough to account for any processing delays. If you're uncertain whether your appeal is timely, file it anyway and let the court determine timeliness; filing late is better than not filing at all if you have even a potential argument for extension."

Include the required filing fee, which is approximately $75 but varies by county. If you cannot afford the fee, file Form FW-001 (Request to Waive Court Fees) along with your appeal. The clerk will process your appeal and transfer the case to the Superior Court's civil division for a new trial (called a trial de novo). You'll receive notice of the new hearing date, typically scheduled 30-70 days after the appeal is filed. The appeal hearing is a completely new trial where both sides present their evidence and arguments fresh. Unlike the original small claims hearing, attorneys can represent either party at the appeal hearing. Begin preparing your case immediately after filing, gathering all evidence and identifying witnesses you want to present at the new trial."

The judge will not review the small claims court decision for errors; instead, both parties present their cases entirely anew. The Superior Court judge will hear testimony, review evidence, and make a fresh decision based on the new hearing. Unlike small claims court, attorneys can represent either or both parties at the appeal hearing. The rules of evidence are more formally applied, though the hearing remains relatively informal compared to full civil trials. Both parties can introduce new evidence not presented in small claims court. The burden of proof remains on the original plaintiff to prove their case. The judge will issue a new judgment that completely replaces the small claims judgment. This judgment is final and cannot be appealed further except in very limited circumstances involving legal errors."

            "text": "Yes, the judgment amount can change on appeal, and the outcome can actually become worse for the appealing defendant. Since the appeal is a trial de novo (new trial), the Superior Court judge makes an independent decision based on the evidence presented at the appeal hearing. The judge is not limited by the small claims court's decision and can award the same amount, a higher amount up to the small claims limit, a lower amount, or nothing at all. For defendants appealing, there's a risk that a better-prepared plaintiff or additional evidence could result in a larger judgment than originally awarded. Similarly, a strong defense might reduce or eliminate the judgment. The original plaintiff can also present their case more effectively with attorney assistance, potentially increasing recovery. If you filed a defendant's claim (counterclaim) in small claims court, that claim will also be reheard, and the outcome may differ. Consider the risks carefully before appealing a relatively small judgment."

            "text": "Unlike the original small claims hearing, attorneys can represent parties at the appeal hearing in Superior Court. Whether you need a lawyer depends on the complexity of your case, the amount at stake, and your comfort with court procedures. If the other side hires an attorney and you don't, you may be at a disadvantage, especially if legal issues are involved. However, many people successfully handle small claims appeals without attorneys because the amounts usually don't justify attorney fees. If you decide to represent yourself, prepare thoroughly by organizing your evidence, practicing your presentation, and understanding the legal elements you need to prove or disprove. Consider consulting with an attorney for advice even if you don't hire one to represent you. Some attorneys offer limited scope representation, such as preparing you for the hearing without actually appearing. Evaluate the cost-benefit: if attorney fees would exceed your potential recovery or loss, self-representation may make more sense."

You must show good cause for your absence, such as never receiving proper notice of the hearing, experiencing a serious medical emergency, having a death in the family, or other circumstances beyond your control. Simply forgetting, having schedule conflicts, or transportation problems typically don't constitute good cause. Along with your motion, file a declaration explaining why you missed the hearing and attaching any supporting documents like medical records or proof of the emergency. You must also demonstrate that you have a meritorious defense to the plaintiff's claim. If the court grants your motion, the default judgment is vacated and a new hearing date is set. If your motion is denied, you may still be able to appeal within 30 days if you qualify as a defendant."

First, verify the deadline has actually passed by checking when the Notice of Entry of Judgment was mailed. If exceptional circumstances prevented you from appealing, such as never receiving notice due to incorrect address, being incapacitated, or other extreme circumstances, you may file a motion for relief from default under Code of Civil Procedure Section 473. This must be filed within a reasonable time and no more than six months after entry of judgment. You must show your failure to appeal was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, not just carelessness or ignorance. Alternatively, if the plaintiff committed fraud or the judgment was obtained through perjury, you may have grounds for a motion to set aside the judgment. If none of these options apply, the judgment stands and becomes final and enforceable. Your focus should then shift to payment arrangements or handling collection efforts."

            "text": "Filing an appeal does not automatically stop enforcement of a California small claims judgment. To prevent the winning party from collecting on the judgment while your appeal is pending, you must post a bond or make a cash deposit with the court. The bond amount is typically the judgment amount plus estimated interest and costs for the appeal period. If you don't post a bond, the plaintiff can proceed with collection efforts including wage garnishment, bank levies, and property liens while your appeal is pending. If you eventually win the appeal, you would need to pursue recovery of any amounts already collected. To stay enforcement, file Form SC-140 (Notice of Appeal) along with a request for stay of enforcement and either a bond from a licensed surety company or cash deposit. The court clerk can provide information about the required amount. If you cannot afford a bond, you may request a waiver, though these are rarely granted. Posting a bond protects your assets during the appeal process."

Your appeal rights depend on your overall position: if you were the original defendant, you can appeal the judgment against you on the plaintiff's claim and also appeal the denial of your counterclaim. The appeal of the entire matter will be heard together in Superior Court. Remember that in a trial de novo, both the plaintiff's claim and your counterclaim will be reheard completely. You must file Form SC-140 (Notice of Appeal) within 30 days and pay the required fee. Be aware that on appeal, the plaintiff may be better prepared or have attorney representation, potentially strengthening their case against you. Similarly, you'll have another opportunity to present your counterclaim, possibly with more evidence or better preparation. Carefully evaluate whether the amount at stake justifies the time, cost, and uncertainty of the appeal process."

                    <p>A California small claims appeal results in a trial de novo, meaning a completely new trial in Superior Court where the case is heard from the beginning as if the small claims hearing never occurred. The judge will not review the small claims court decision for errors; instead, both parties present their cases entirely anew.</p>
                    <p>The Superior Court judge will hear testimony, review evidence, and make a fresh decision based on the new hearing. Unlike small claims court, attorneys can represent either or both parties. Both parties can introduce new evidence not presented in small claims court. The burden of proof remains on the original plaintiff. The judge will issue a new judgment that completely replaces the small claims judgment. This judgment is final and cannot be appealed further except in very limited circumstances.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, the judgment amount can change on appeal, and the outcome can actually become worse for the appealing defendant. Since the appeal is a trial de novo (new trial), the Superior Court judge makes an independent decision based on the evidence presented at the appeal hearing. The judge is not limited by the small claims court's decision and can award:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The same amount as the original judgment</li>
                        <li>A higher amount up to the small claims limit</li>
                        <li>A lower amount</li>
                        <li>Nothing at all</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For defendants appealing, there's a risk that a better-prepared plaintiff or additional evidence could result in a larger judgment. Consider the risks carefully before appealing a relatively small judgment.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Unlike the original small claims hearing, attorneys can represent parties at the appeal hearing in Superior Court. Whether you need a lawyer depends on the complexity of your case, the amount at stake, and your comfort with court procedures. If the other side hires an attorney and you don't, you may be at a disadvantage.</p>
                    <p>However, many people successfully handle small claims appeals without attorneys because the amounts usually don't justify attorney fees. If you decide to represent yourself, prepare thoroughly by organizing your evidence, practicing your presentation, and understanding the legal elements you need to prove or disprove. Consider consulting with an attorney for advice even if you don't hire one to represent you. Evaluate the cost-benefit: if attorney fees would exceed your potential recovery or loss, self-representation may make more sense.</p>

                    <p>If you missed your California small claims hearing and a default judgment was entered against you, you can file a motion to vacate (set aside) the judgment using Form SC-135 (Notice of Motion to Vacate Judgment) within 30 days after the clerk mails the Notice of Entry of Judgment. You must show good cause for your absence, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Never receiving proper notice of the hearing</li>
                        <li>Experiencing a serious medical emergency</li>

                        <li>Other circumstances beyond your control</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Simply forgetting or having schedule conflicts typically don't constitute good cause. Along with your motion, file a declaration explaining why you missed the hearing and demonstrate that you have a meritorious defense to the plaintiff's claim. If granted, a new hearing date is set.</p>

                    <p>If you've missed the 30-day deadline to appeal a California small claims judgment, your options are limited but not nonexistent. First, verify the deadline has actually passed by checking when the Notice of Entry of Judgment was mailed. If exceptional circumstances prevented you from appealing, you may file a motion for relief from default.</p>
                    <p>This must be filed within a reasonable time and no more than six months after entry of judgment. You must show your failure to appeal was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, not just carelessness. Alternatively, if the plaintiff committed fraud or the judgment was obtained through perjury, you may have grounds for a motion to set aside the judgment. If none of these options apply, the judgment stands and becomes final and enforceable.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Filing an appeal does not automatically stop enforcement of a California small claims judgment. To prevent the winning party from collecting on the judgment while your appeal is pending, you must post a bond or make a cash deposit with the court. The bond amount is typically the judgment amount plus estimated interest and costs for the appeal period.</p>
                    <p>If you don't post a bond, the plaintiff can proceed with collection efforts including wage garnishment, bank levies, and property liens while your appeal is pending. To stay enforcement, file Form SC-140 (Notice of Appeal) along with a request for stay of enforcement and either a bond from a licensed surety company or cash deposit. If you cannot afford a bond, you may request a waiver, though these are rarely granted.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, if you filed a Defendant's Claim (counterclaim) in small claims court and lost on that claim, you can appeal the portion of the judgment denying your counterclaim. Your appeal rights depend on your overall position: if you were the original defendant, you can appeal the judgment against you on the plaintiff's claim and also appeal the denial of your counterclaim.</p>
                    <p>The appeal of the entire matter will be heard together in Superior Court. Remember that in a trial de novo, both the plaintiff's claim and your counterclaim will be reheard completely. You must file Form SC-140 (Notice of Appeal) within 30 days and pay the required fee. Carefully evaluate whether the amount at stake justifies the time, cost, and uncertainty of the appeal process.</p>
