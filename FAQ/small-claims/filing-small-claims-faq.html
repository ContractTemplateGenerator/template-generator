If the defendant has moved, you may need SC-110 (Request to Postpone Trial). For cases involving motor vehicle accidents, the court may provide additional optional worksheets. All forms are available free at California courts' self-help centers or online at courts.ca.gov.

For claims between $1,500.01 and $5,000, the fee is $50 or $100 respectively. For claims between $5,000.01 and $10,000, the fee is $75 or $100 respectively. Additional costs may include service of process fees ($25-75 for personal service by a process server or sheriff), costs for certified mail service, and potential witness fees. If you cannot afford these fees, you may apply for a fee waiver by filing Form FW-001. The court may also award these costs to the winning party as part of the judgment."

Generally, you must file where the defendant lives or where a business defendant has its principal place of business. Alternatively, you may file where the contract was signed or was to be performed, where the buyer or lessee resided at contract time for consumer transactions, or where injury to person or damage to property occurred. For landlord-tenant disputes, file where the rental property is located. If you file in the wrong court, the defendant can request a transfer to the proper venue, which will delay your case. If the defendant doesn't object, the court may still hear your case. For disputes involving online transactions, the venue is typically where you resided when you entered the contract."

For businesses, you can serve an officer, general manager, or person authorized to receive process. Service must be completed at least 15 days before the hearing for defendants within the county, or 20 days for out-of-county defendants. After service, the server must complete a Proof of Service form (SC-104) which must be filed with the court before your hearing."

Common cases include breach of contract disputes, property damage claims, landlord-tenant security deposit disputes, unpaid wages or commissions, personal injury from accidents, disputes over services not performed or poorly performed, return of personal property or its value, bad check claims, and vehicle accident damage. You can only sue for money damages in small claims court - you cannot ask the court to order someone to do something or stop doing something (injunctive relief). If your claim involves property, you can sue for the fair market value of the property. For breach of contract, you can recover actual damages plus consequential damages that were foreseeable. Small claims courts are designed for straightforward disputes and may not be appropriate for complex legal issues requiring extensive documentation or expert testimony."

For written contracts, you have four years from the date of breach. For oral contracts, the limit is two years. Personal injury claims must be filed within two years from the date of injury. Property damage claims have a three-year limit. Fraud claims allow three years from the date you discovered or should have discovered the fraud. For returned check claims, you have one year. Landlord-tenant security deposit disputes must be filed within two years. These deadlines are strictly enforced - if you miss your deadline, the court will dismiss your case. The time limit begins when the cause of action accrues, which is typically when the breach or injury occurred, not when you discovered it, except in fraud cases. Consider filing promptly to preserve evidence and witness recollections."

            "text": "Yes, you can sue an out-of-state defendant in California small claims court, but you must establish proper jurisdiction. California courts can exercise jurisdiction over non-residents who have sufficient minimum contacts with California under Code of Civil Procedure Section 410.10. This typically means the defendant conducted business in California, the contract was formed or to be performed in California, or the injury or damage occurred in California. You must serve the out-of-state defendant at least 20 days before the hearing date. Service can be accomplished by certified mail with return receipt, by hiring a process server in the defendant's state, or through substitute service methods. Be aware that even if you obtain a judgment, collecting from an out-of-state defendant can be challenging. You may need to domesticate your California judgment in the defendant's home state using the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, which involves additional procedures and potential costs."

You must then arrange for proper service on the defendant within the required timeframe. The defendant may file a response or claim against you (a defendant's claim using Form SC-120). Before the hearing, gather all your evidence including documents, photos, receipts, and contracts. Consider bringing witnesses who can support your version of events. Some courts offer free small claims advisors who can help you prepare. On the hearing day, arrive early with organized documents and copies for the judge and defendant. The judge will hear both sides, ask questions, and examine evidence. In California, decisions are often announced by mail rather than immediately in court. If you win, the judge will issue a judgment in your favor. The defendant typically has 30 days to pay before you can begin collection efforts."

            "text": "Yes, you can amend your small claims complaint in California using Form SC-104 (Amendment to Plaintiff's Claim) before your hearing date. Common reasons for amendments include correcting the defendant's name or address, adding or removing defendants, changing the claim amount based on new information, or clarifying the description of your claim. If you need to add a significant amount to your claim that exceeds the small claims limit, you'll need to decide whether to file a new case in civil court or reduce your claim to stay within small claims limits. For minor corrections, you may be able to make them at the hearing with the judge's permission. If changes affect service requirements, you may need to re-serve the defendant and request a continuance to allow adequate notice. There is typically a small fee for filing an amendment. It's best to file amendments as early as possible to avoid delays and ensure the defendant has adequate notice of the changes."

                        <li>Claims up to $1,500: $30 (or $100 if 12+ cases filed in past year)</li>

                    <p>California small claims cases must be filed in the proper venue, which is determined by specific rules. Generally, you must file where the defendant lives or where a business defendant has its principal place of business. Alternative venues include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Where the contract was signed or was to be performed</li>
                        <li>Where the buyer or lessee resided at contract time for consumer transactions</li>
                        <li>Where injury to person or damage to property occurred</li>
                        <li>Where the rental property is located for landlord-tenant disputes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you file in the wrong court, the defendant can request a transfer to the proper venue, which will delay your case. If the defendant doesn't object, the court may still hear your case. For disputes involving online transactions, the venue is typically where you resided when you entered the contract.</p>

                    <p>Proper service is critical to your small claims case. In California, you cannot serve the papers yourself. Service options include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personal service: Someone 18+ who is not a party hands documents directly to the defendant</li>
                        <li>Substituted service: Papers left with a responsible adult at defendant's home or workplace plus mailing a copy</li>
                        <li>Certified mail with return receipt requested</li>
                        <li>Service by professional process server or sheriff</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For businesses, you can serve an officer, general manager, or person authorized to receive process. Service must be completed at least 15 days before the hearing for defendants within the county, or 20 days for out-of-county defendants. After service, the server must complete a Proof of Service form (SC-104) which must be filed with the court before your hearing.</p>

                    <p>California small claims court handles various civil disputes where you seek money damages up to the jurisdictional limit. Common cases include:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <p>California imposes strict statutes of limitations for filing small claims cases, and these deadlines vary by claim type:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Written contracts: 4 years from breach date</li>
                        <li>Oral contracts: 2 years</li>
                        <li>Personal injury claims: 2 years from injury date</li>
                        <li>Property damage claims: 3 years</li>
                        <li>Fraud claims: 3 years from discovery</li>
                        <li>Returned check claims: 1 year</li>
                        <li>Security deposit disputes: 2 years</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These deadlines are strictly enforced - if you miss your deadline, the court will dismiss your case. The time limit begins when the cause of action accrues, which is typically when the breach or injury occurred, not when you discovered it, except in fraud cases. Consider filing promptly to preserve evidence and witness recollections.</p>

                    <p>Yes, you can sue an out-of-state defendant in California small claims court, but you must establish proper jurisdiction. California courts can exercise jurisdiction over non-residents who have sufficient minimum contacts with California. This typically means the defendant conducted business in California, the contract was formed or to be performed in California, or the injury or damage occurred in California.</p>
                    <p>You must serve the out-of-state defendant at least 20 days before the hearing date. Service can be accomplished by certified mail with return receipt, by hiring a process server in the defendant's state, or through substitute service methods. Be aware that even if you obtain a judgment, collecting from an out-of-state defendant can be challenging. You may need to domesticate your California judgment in the defendant's home state using the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>After filing your small claims case, several important steps follow. First, the clerk will assign a hearing date, usually within 30-70 days of filing. You must then arrange for proper service on the defendant within the required timeframe. The defendant may file a response or claim against you (a defendant's claim using Form SC-120).</p>
                    <p>Before the hearing, gather all your evidence including documents, photos, receipts, and contracts. Consider bringing witnesses who can support your version of events. Some courts offer free small claims advisors who can help you prepare. On the hearing day, arrive early with organized documents and copies for the judge and defendant. The judge will hear both sides, ask questions, and examine evidence. In California, decisions are often announced by mail rather than immediately in court. If you win, the judge will issue a judgment in your favor, and the defendant typically has 30 days to pay before you can begin collection efforts.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, you can amend your small claims complaint in California using Form SC-104 (Amendment to Plaintiff's Claim) before your hearing date. Common reasons for amendments include correcting the defendant's name or address, adding or removing defendants, changing the claim amount based on new information, or clarifying the description of your claim.</p>
                    <p>If you need to add a significant amount to your claim that exceeds the small claims limit, you'll need to decide whether to file a new case in civil court or reduce your claim to stay within small claims limits. For minor corrections, you may be able to make them at the hearing with the judge's permission. If changes affect service requirements, you may need to re-serve the defendant and request a continuance to allow adequate notice. There is typically a small fee for filing an amendment. It's best to file amendments as early as possible to avoid delays and ensure the defendant has adequate notice of the changes.</p>
