First, check for injuries and call 911 if anyone needs medical attention. Move to safety if possible, but don't leave the scene. California law requires you to stop and exchange information after any accident involving injury, death, or property damage. Exchange information with other drivers including names, addresses, phone numbers, driver's license numbers, insurance company names and policy numbers, and vehicle registration information. Document the scene by taking photographs of all vehicles showing damage, the accident location including street signs and landmarks, skid marks and debris, weather and road conditions, and any visible injuries. Get witness names and contact information. File a police report, which is required for accidents involving injury or death, and helpful for all accidents. Seek medical attention even if you feel fine, as some injuries appear later. Notify your insurance company promptly, but be cautious about giving recorded statements to the other driver's insurer."

            "text": "California imposes strict deadlines called statutes of limitations for filing car accident claims. For personal injury claims, you have two years from the date of the accident to file a lawsuit. For property damage claims, you have three years from the accident date. If your claim is against a government entity, such as a city vehicle or state highway defect, you must file a Government Tort Claim within six months of the accident under Government Code Section 911.2. Missing these deadlines typically means losing your right to sue entirely. Insurance claims have separate, shorter deadlines specified in your policy, typically requiring prompt notification within days or weeks of an accident. While you should report accidents to insurers immediately, the legal deadline for filing suit is what ultimately limits your rights. Acting quickly preserves evidence, ensures witness memories are fresh, and allows adequate time for investigation and negotiation before the deadline approaches."

            "text": "California uses a pure comparative negligence system to determine fault in car accidents, meaning each party's responsibility is assessed as a percentage, and your recovery is reduced by your share of fault. Evidence used to determine fault includes the police report and investigating officer's conclusions, physical evidence such as vehicle damage patterns and skid marks, witness statements about each driver's actions, traffic camera or dashcam footage, expert accident reconstruction analysis, and violations of traffic laws. Common fault indicators include rear-end collisions (following driver usually at fault), left-turn accidents (turning driver often at fault), and running red lights or stop signs. Multiple parties can share fault. For example, if you're found 30% at fault and suffered $100,000 in damages, you can recover $70,000 from other at-fault parties. Insurance adjusters, judges, and juries all apply these principles when evaluating fault. Gather as much evidence as possible to support your version of events."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "California car accident victims can recover both economic and non-economic damages. Economic damages are quantifiable financial losses including medical expenses for emergency care, hospitalization, surgery, physical therapy, medications, and future treatment, lost wages for time missed from work during recovery, lost earning capacity if injuries affect your ability to work long-term, property damage for vehicle repair or replacement costs, rental car expenses, and out-of-pocket costs for medical equipment and home modifications. Non-economic damages compensate for subjective losses including pain and suffering from physical injuries, emotional distress such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of consortium affecting spousal relationships. California doesn't cap non-economic damages in regular car accident cases. In cases involving drunk driving, intentional misconduct, or egregious behavior, punitive damages may be available to punish the wrongdoer. Document all damages thoroughly with receipts, bills, and journals describing your daily impact."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "You should rarely accept an insurance company's first settlement offer without careful evaluation. Initial offers are typically low because insurers aim to minimize payouts and often make quick offers before the full extent of injuries and damages is known. Before accepting any offer, ensure you understand the complete scope of your injuries by reaching out to medical professionals and waiting until you've reached maximum medical improvement or have a clear prognosis. Calculate your total damages including future medical care, lost wages, pain and suffering, and any long-term impacts. Compare the offer to your calculated damages to see if it's reasonable. Consider whether you've accounted for diminished earning capacity if injuries affect your work. Once you accept a settlement and sign a release, you typically cannot pursue additional compensation later, even if your injuries worsen or you discover additional damages. Counter the initial offer with a demand letter explaining why you deserve more, supported by evidence. Negotiations often result in significantly higher settlements than initial offers."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Whether you need a lawyer depends on your accident's complexity and severity. Consider handling your own claim if injuries are minor with quick recovery, liability is clear, you're comfortable negotiating with insurers, and total damages are relatively small. Consider hiring a lawyer if you suffered serious injuries requiring extensive treatment, there's disputed liability or multiple parties involved, the insurance company denies your claim or offers an unreasonably low settlement, you have permanent injuries or disability, the at-fault driver was uninsured or underinsured, or you're dealing with complex legal issues like government liability. Most car accident lawyers work on contingency, meaning they take a percentage (typically 33-40%) of your recovery and charge nothing upfront. They often recover more than enough to offset their fees. Statistics suggest represented claimants receive higher settlements on average, even after attorney fees. Many attorneys offer free consultations to evaluate whether representation makes sense for your situation."

At the scene, gather photographs of all vehicles from multiple angles showing damage, the accident scene including traffic signs, road conditions, and weather, skid marks, debris, and any physical evidence, other drivers' license plates and insurance cards, and contact information for all witnesses. After the accident, obtain the police report or CHP collision report, all medical records documenting injuries and treatment, medical bills and receipts for all related expenses, proof of lost wages from your employer, repair estimates and invoices for vehicle damage, rental car receipts, and correspondence with insurance companies. Additional valuable evidence includes dashcam footage from your vehicle or witnesses, surveillance video from nearby businesses, 911 call recordings, and expert reports such as accident reconstruction or medical opinions. Keep a daily journal documenting your pain levels, limitations, and how injuries affect your life. Organize evidence chronologically and maintain copies of everything."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes, California's pure comparative negligence law allows you to recover damages even if you were partially at fault for the accident. Your recovery is simply reduced by your percentage of fault. For example, if you suffered $50,000 in damages but were found 25% at fault for failing to signal, you can still recover $37,500 (75% of your damages) from the other driver. This applies even if you were more than 50% at fault. If you were 80% at fault and the other driver was 20% at fault, you could still recover 20% of your damages from them. However, the other driver could also recover 80% of their damages from you. Insurance adjusters and courts consider all evidence when assigning fault percentages, including traffic violations, witness statements, and physical evidence. Don't assume you can't recover just because you may have contributed to the accident. Consult with an attorney to understand how comparative negligence applies to your specific circumstances."

            "text": "Filing a third-party claim against the at-fault driver's insurance company involves several steps in California. First, obtain the other driver's insurance information at the accident scene, including company name, policy number, and contact information. Report the accident to the other driver's insurance company by phone or through their website, providing basic information about the accident without admitting fault or giving a detailed recorded statement. The insurance company will assign a claims adjuster to investigate. The adjuster may contact you for a recorded statement, which you're not legally required to provide to the other driver's insurer. They'll assess vehicle damage and may request medical records. After investigation, the adjuster will make a liability determination and potentially a settlement offer. You can negotiate, counter-offer, or reject their offer. If negotiations fail, you may need to file a lawsuit. You can also file a claim with your own insurance if you have applicable coverage and let them pursue subrogation. Document all communications with the insurance company in writing."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "If the at-fault driver is uninsured, you have several options for recovering damages in California. First, check your own insurance policy for uninsured motorist coverage (UM), which covers your injuries caused by uninsured drivers. California law requires insurers to offer UM coverage, though you may have declined it. If you have UM coverage, file a claim with your own insurance company. You can also sue the uninsured driver directly in civil court, but collecting from an individual without insurance may be difficult if they lack assets. For property damage, you may have uninsured motorist property damage coverage (UMPD) or collision coverage that would cover repairs minus your deductible. If the at-fault driver is underinsured (has insurance but not enough to cover your damages), your underinsured motorist coverage (UIM) can provide additional compensation. Driving without insurance is illegal in California, and uninsured drivers can face license suspension and vehicle impoundment. Consider consulting an attorney to explore all recovery options against an uninsured motorist."

                    <ul>
                        <li>Medical expenses (emergency care, surgery, therapy, medications, future treatment)</li>

                    <p>Non-economic damages include pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of consortium. California doesn't cap non-economic damages in regular car accident cases. In cases involving drunk driving or egregious behavior, punitive damages may be available.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You should rarely accept an insurance company's first settlement offer without careful evaluation. Initial offers are typically low because insurers aim to minimize payouts and often make quick offers before the full extent of injuries is known.</p>
                    <p>Before accepting any offer, ensure you understand the complete scope of your injuries, calculate your total damages including future medical care and lost wages, and compare the offer to your calculated damages. Once you accept a settlement and sign a release, you typically cannot pursue additional compensation later, even if injuries worsen. Counter the initial offer with a demand letter explaining why you deserve more, supported by evidence. Negotiations often result in significantly higher settlements than initial offers.</p>

                    <p>Whether you need a lawyer depends on your accident's complexity and severity. Consider handling your own claim if injuries are minor, liability is clear, and total damages are relatively small.</p>
                    <p>Consider hiring a lawyer if you suffered serious injuries, there's disputed liability or multiple parties involved, the insurance company denies your claim or offers an unreasonably low settlement, you have permanent injuries, the at-fault driver was uninsured, or you're dealing with complex legal issues. Most car accident lawyers work on contingency (33-40% of recovery) and charge nothing upfront. Statistics suggest represented claimants receive higher settlements on average, even after attorney fees. Many attorneys offer free consultations.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, California's pure comparative negligence law allows you to recover damages even if you were partially at fault. Your recovery is simply reduced by your percentage of fault. For example, if you suffered $50,000 in damages but were found 25% at fault, you can still recover $37,500.</p>
                    <p>This applies even if you were more than 50% at fault. If you were 80% at fault and the other driver 20% at fault, you could still recover 20% of your damages from them (though they could recover 80% of their damages from you). Insurance adjusters and courts consider all evidence when assigning fault percentages. Don't assume you can't recover just because you may have contributed to the accident.</p>

                    <p>Filing a third-party claim against the at-fault driver's insurance company involves several steps. First, obtain the other driver's insurance information at the scene. Report the accident to their insurance company by phone or website, providing basic information without admitting fault or giving detailed recorded statements.</p>
                    <p>The insurance company will assign a claims adjuster to investigate. The adjuster may request a recorded statement (which you're not legally required to provide) and will assess damages. After investigation, they'll make a liability determination and potentially a settlement offer. You can negotiate, counter-offer, or reject their offer. If negotiations fail, you may need to file a lawsuit. Document all communications in writing.</p>

                    <p>If the at-fault driver is uninsured, you have several recovery options. Check your own policy for uninsured motorist coverage (UM), which covers injuries caused by uninsured drivers. California law requires insurers to offer UM coverage, though you may have declined it.</p>
                    <p>If you have UM coverage, file a claim with your own insurance. You can also sue the uninsured driver directly, but collecting may be difficult if they lack assets. For property damage, you may have uninsured motorist property damage (UMPD) or collision coverage. If the at-fault driver is underinsured, your underinsured motorist coverage (UIM) can provide additional compensation. Consult an attorney to explore all recovery options.</p>
