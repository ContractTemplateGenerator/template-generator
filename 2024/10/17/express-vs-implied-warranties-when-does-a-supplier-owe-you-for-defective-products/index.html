<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Introduction"></span>Introduction<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Warranties are fundamental to commercial transactions. Whenever goods are sold—be it through a small online marketplace or a large distribution contract—buyers and sellers rely on warranties, whether explicitly stated or implied by law, to allocate the risks of defective products. Understanding these warranties is especially vital in jurisdictions like California that have nuanced rules, influenced by both state legislation and federal consumer-protection statutes.</p>



<p>This discussion provides a comprehensive, in-depth look at express and implied warranties under U.S. federal law and California law. It covers how warranties arise, what they entail, how they can be disclaimed, and what remedies are available when a product fails to meet the warranty’s terms. It also clarifies key distinctions—such as the difference between express warranties made verbally or in writing and warranties implied by law. Ultimately, the goal is to illustrate when a supplier (or manufacturer) owes a buyer for defective products and how these obligations can shape litigation or dispute-resolution strategies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Foundations_of_Warranties_in_Commercial_Transactions"></span>Foundations of Warranties in Commercial Transactions<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Warranties serve as assurances that a product meets certain standards. They exist to protect buyers against the economic harm of receiving subpar goods, while also encouraging sellers to uphold a minimum standard of quality. The legal framework for warranties in most jurisdictions, including California, is strongly influenced by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Although California has its own Commercial Code, its provisions on warranties largely parallel the UCC’s approach, albeit with a few state-specific twists.</p>



<p>In general, there are two primary categories of warranties: express warranties and implied warranties. An express warranty arises from clear representations made by a seller regarding the goods, while implied warranties arise by operation of law to ensure, at a minimum, that goods are fit for their ordinary uses and conform to basic quality standards.</p>



<p>Sales of goods in California are governed primarily by Division 2 of the California Commercial Code, which closely tracks Article 2 of the UCC. Consumer transactions may also be subject to additional statutes, such as the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. These laws impose additional requirements and limitations on how warranties can be made and disclaimed, particularly in consumer contexts.</p>



<p>Nature and Purpose of Warranties</p>



<p>A warranty can be viewed as a promise about the nature, quality, or performance of a product. For example, a warranty might guarantee that a piece of machinery is free from defects for a specified period, or that a product is suited for a particular use. Legal warranties thus address the gap in information or bargaining power between buyers and sellers, providing recourse for buyers who discover latent or undisclosed defects.</p>



<p>For business buyers (as opposed to individual consumers), warranties are equally crucial—though the level of statutory protection can differ. Even in a commercial sale, implied warranties may apply unless expressly and conspicuously disclaimed. Given the complexities of warranty law, parties often negotiate contractual language to clarify or limit the warranties that accompany the sale. However, as will be explored, certain limitations are prohibited or restricted by law.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Express_Warranties"></span>Express Warranties<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Defining Express Warranties</p>



<p>An express warranty arises when a seller makes an affirmative statement or representation about the goods that becomes part of the “basis of the bargain.” Examples of express warranties include:</p>



<p>• A seller’s statement that a particular pump “can operate in sub-zero temperatures without freezing”<br>• Product advertisements or brochures stating that the goods are “100% stainless steel” or “rustproof”<br>• A seller’s sample or model that demonstrates a product’s characteristics and is presented to the buyer prior to sale<br>• A written warranty included in the product packaging indicating that the item will perform certain functions for a certain period</p>



<p>Under California Commercial Code § 2313 (paralleling UCC § 2-313), express warranties can be created in multiple ways:</p>



<p>• <strong>Affirmation of Fact or Promise</strong>: If a seller tells the buyer that the goods have a certain level of quality, capacity, or functionality, and that statement is part of the deal, it can constitute an express warranty.<br>• <strong>Description of the Goods</strong>: Labels, tags, or descriptive language about the goods can create an express warranty if the buyer relies on those descriptions when purchasing.<br>• <strong>Sample or Model</strong>: If the seller provides a sample or model and states the sold goods will match that sample’s quality and characteristics, that representation is an express warranty.</p>



<p>The crucial factor is whether the statement or representation formed part of the purchase decision—i.e., whether it was “the basis of the bargain.” Courts generally construe this standard broadly in favor of buyers. Even statements that appear in advertising can become part of the contractual basis if they are specific and material enough.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Express_Warranties_vs_Puffery"></span>Express Warranties vs. Puffery<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Not every statement a seller makes is an express warranty. Sellers often use promotional language or “puffery”—vague, subjective claims about the product’s excellence or desirability. For instance, a car salesman’s pitch that a vehicle is “the best ride on the market” is typically viewed as puffery rather than a binding warranty. By contrast, a concrete statement—e.g., “this truck can tow up to 10,000 pounds”—is far more likely to be considered an express warranty if it is significant to the buyer’s decision.</p>



<p>Courts usually differentiate between factual representations (measurable, verifiable attributes or capabilities) and mere opinions or hyperbole (subjective statements about product superiority). Once it crosses into an objectively verifiable statement, it risks becoming an express warranty.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Forms_of_Express_Warranties"></span>Forms of Express Warranties<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Express warranties can be made orally or in writing. They can also be included on labels, in product manuals, or in a manufacturer’s marketing materials. A key point is that an express warranty need not carry the specific language “warranty” or “guarantee.” Any specific promise or representation about the product’s quality or performance can suffice.</p>



<p>In consumer transactions, the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act imposes additional labeling requirements and terminology constraints on written warranties, particularly if they are described as “full” or “limited.” But beyond these formalities, the question is always whether the seller’s representation was a genuine affirmation of fact that induced the sale.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Breach_of_an_Express_Warranty"></span>Breach of an Express Warranty<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>An express warranty is breached when the goods do not conform to the seller’s representations or promises. For instance, if a product is promised to be non-corrosive but rusts within a short time, the express warranty has been breached. Similarly, if a seller promises that a complex piece of machinery can handle certain loads and it fails to do so under normal operating conditions, that is likely a breach.</p>



<p>Remedies for express warranty breaches under the California Commercial Code can include repair or replacement of the defective goods, rescission of the sales contract, incidental damages, and in some cases, consequential damages. However, the parties can sometimes limit or shape these remedies through contractual clauses, subject to constraints that they not be unconscionable or otherwise invalid under consumer protection statutes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Disclaiming_Express_Warranties"></span>Disclaiming Express Warranties<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Because express warranties stem from sellers’ statements, disclaiming them requires caution. A disclaimer cannot erase or nullify a representation that is part of the basis of the bargain. If a written agreement plainly contradicts an express oral representation, courts may delve into whether the written disclaimer was conspicuous and whether the buyer agreed to forego relying on the earlier representation.</p>



<p>In consumer contexts, disclaimers of express warranties are heavily scrutinized. If a manufacturer or retailer prints disclaimers that conflict with unequivocal statements made in advertisements or instructions, a court may hold the disclaimers ineffective. Similarly, disclaimers that attempt to disclaim all warranties, including ones explicitly made in a marketing brochure, often fail.</p>



<p>Thus, while parties can attempt to write disclaimers that limit the impact of certain claims, disclaimers that contradict clear representations can be legally problematic. In short, once an express warranty is made, disclaiming it after the fact is difficult.</p>

<p>Beyond express warranties, the law also imposes implied warranties—unwritten guarantees that automatically accompany certain transactions unless effectively disclaimed. Under California law (and the UCC generally), two key implied warranties typically arise in the sale of goods:</p>



<p>• The implied warranty of merchantability<br>• The implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose</p>



<p>Merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose each serve distinct roles. They ensure that goods meet fundamental expectations about quality, usability, and suitability. Under certain consumer protection statutes, these implied warranties cannot be waived or limited, or can only be waived in strict compliance with statutory requirements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Implied_Warranty_of_Merchantability"></span>Implied Warranty of Merchantability<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Definition and Scope</p>



<p>The implied warranty of merchantability is codified in California Commercial Code § 2314. It applies automatically when the seller is a “merchant” with respect to goods of that kind. A “merchant” is someone who deals in goods of the particular type or otherwise holds themself out as having knowledge or skill specific to the practices or goods involved in the transaction. For example, a dealership selling cars is a merchant, whereas an occasional private seller disposing of a personal vehicle is not.</p>



<p>Merchantability sets out a baseline standard: the goods must be fit for the ordinary purposes for which they are used, pass without objection in the trade, and conform to promises or affirmations made on the container or label (if any). This means that if a buyer purchases a standard consumer product like a toaster, the toaster is expected to toast bread safely and effectively, at least for some normal period of use. If the toaster fails almost immediately under normal conditions, the seller may be liable for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Criteria_for_Merchantability"></span>Criteria for Merchantability<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>



<p>Under the typical UCC-derived standards, goods are considered merchantable if they:</p>



<p>• Pass without objection in the trade under the contract description<br>• Are of fair or average quality within the description<br>• Are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used<br>• Run, within the variations permitted by the agreement, of even kind, quality, and quantity within each unit and among all units involved<br>• Are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the agreement may require<br>• Conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label</p>



<p>These factors ensure the buyer receives something reasonably aligned with general commercial standards for that type of product.</p>

<p>A breach occurs when the goods fail to function as typical goods of their kind would. The buyer does not need to prove negligence or fault on the seller’s part; the mere fact that the product is unfit for its ordinary use is sufficient. For example, if a buyer purchases a set of tires that blow out under normal driving conditions, that might be a breach of merchantability. Similarly, if newly purchased software repeatedly corrupts files under normal usage, it may be unfit for its ordinary purpose, though software warranties can be particularly nuanced.</p>



<p>Damages can include repair costs, the cost of purchasing a replacement, and other consequential damages if they were reasonably foreseeable. In consumer contexts, additional statutory rights might arise, such as attorney’s fees in certain consumer protection actions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Implied_Warranty_of_Fitness_for_a_Particular_Purpose"></span>Implied Warranty of Fitness for a Particular Purpose<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>Definition and Triggering Conditions</p>



<p>Distinct from merchantability, the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose arises under California Commercial Code § 2315 when:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The seller has reason to know the buyer’s particular purpose for purchasing the goods;</li>



<li>The seller has reason to know the buyer is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment to furnish suitable goods; and</li>



<li>The buyer actually relies on the seller’s skill or judgment in making the purchase decision.</li>
</ol>



<p>The “particular purpose” differs from the ordinary purpose. For instance, a farmer might buy a tractor specifically to navigate unusually muddy fields, telling the seller about these conditions. If the seller, aware of the buyer’s unique needs, recommends a certain model that proves unsuitable, the buyer may have a claim for breach of the implied warranty of fitness for that particular purpose. By contrast, an implied warranty of merchantability would only guarantee that the tractor can handle general farming tasks under normal circumstances, not specialized, extraordinary conditions.</p>



<p>Proving Reliance</p>



<p>Reliance is often a key issue in fitness-for-purpose claims. The buyer must show they actually relied on the seller’s representations or expertise in choosing the product. If the buyer has more expertise than the seller or conducts their own independent analysis (thus not relying on the seller’s advice), the implied warranty might not arise. Courts look at factors like whether the buyer or seller is more knowledgeable, whether the buyer requested a recommendation, and whether the seller offered assurances about the product’s capabilities.</p>



<p>Breach of the Implied Warranty of Fitness</p>



<p>When the product fails to fulfill the stated particular purpose, and the buyer relied on the seller’s expertise in selecting the product, a breach occurs. Remedies mirror those for merchantability: cover (obtaining replacement goods), damages for direct and consequential losses, and potentially incidental costs associated with the breach. In some consumer cases, special statutory protections can amplify these remedies or entitle buyers to attorney’s fees or punitive damages if the breach involved egregious conduct.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Disclaimers_of_Implied_Warranties"></span>Disclaimers of Implied Warranties<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>



<p>General Requirements for Disclaimer</p>



<p>Sellers can disclaim or modify implied warranties under commercial law, but the disclaimers must meet specific criteria. The California Commercial Code aligns with the broader UCC standard, requiring that disclaimers of merchantability be conspicuous and expressly mention “merchantability.” For disclaimers of fitness for a particular purpose, the disclaimers typically must be in writing and conspicuous.</p>



<p>A disclaimer is considered conspicuous if it is so written or displayed that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to notice it (e.g., in bold, capital letters, or larger typeface). Courts look at layout, font size, and location in the contract. If a disclaimer is buried in fine print, overshadowed by other text, or placed in an unlikely location, it may not meet the conspicuousness requirement.</p>



<p>“As Is” and “With All Faults” Language</p>



<p>In many commercial or consumer sales, sellers use “as is” or “with all faults” language to disclaim implied warranties. If done correctly and conspicuously, “as is” language can eliminate the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. However, these phrases must be clearly communicated to the buyer before or at the time of sale, and they must meet the general standard for conspicuousness.</p>



<p>That said, even a valid “as is” disclaimer may not protect a seller from liability for intentional misrepresentations, fraud, or other misconduct. Nor does it necessarily eliminate any express warranties the seller made. Additionally, consumer protection statutes in California and federal law often restrict the use of “as is” disclaimers in certain contexts, especially for new consumer goods.</p>



<p>Statutory Restrictions and Exceptions</p>



<p>In consumer transactions, the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, commonly referred to as California’s “lemon law,” sets forth additional warranty protections that supplement or override disclaimers. The Act generally requires that consumer goods sold in California carry an implied warranty of merchantability that cannot be disclaimed—at least within a certain time frame (generally 60 days to one year, depending on the good). The manufacturer or distributor might also have obligations to repair or replace defective goods. Similarly, the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act imposes constraints on disclaimers of implied warranties when a written warranty is provided.</p>



<p>Consequently, while disclaimers are common and legally permissible in many commercial settings, disclaimers in consumer sales are subject to heightened regulation. Sellers must carefully draft disclaimers to avoid running afoul of these statutes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Magnuson-Moss_Warranty_Act_and_Federal_Consumer_Protections"></span>Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and Federal Consumer Protections<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Magnuson-Moss Overview</p>



<p>At the federal level, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act governs written warranties on consumer products (generally personal, family, or household products). It does not require sellers to provide a written warranty, but if they do, the Act sets out rules on how warranties are described and what disclaimers or limitations can be imposed on implied warranties. For instance, if a seller issues a “full warranty,” the Act requires them to remedy defects within a reasonable time and forbids disclaiming or limiting implied warranties. If the warranty is described as “limited,” certain disclaimers of implied warranties might still be permissible, but they face stricter scrutiny.</p>



<p>Applicability to Express and Implied Warranties</p>



<p>Magnuson-Moss primarily regulates the terms and labeling of written warranties, but it also indirectly affects implied warranties. If a written warranty is provided, any implied warranties that arise under state law must run concurrently in duration with the written warranty (though for no less than 60 days). Sellers may attempt to disclaim or limit implied warranties, but the Act requires that these disclaimers be consistent with the consumer protections mandated by the law.</p>



<p>In essence, if a supplier of a consumer good issues a written warranty, they might be restricted from disclaiming implied warranties altogether. Likewise, they may be required to follow specific guidelines about making disclaimers conspicuous and easily understandable for consumers.</p>

<p>Under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, consumer goods sold or leased in California generally come with an implied warranty of merchantability that lasts at least 60 days (and up to one year) from the date of sale, unless the goods are “consummable” or otherwise exempt. The Act broadly protects California consumers who purchase products primarily for personal, family, or household use.</p>



<p>The Act also includes a “lemon law” provision for vehicles, but its warranty protections apply to various types of consumer goods. Sellers who breach this implied warranty may be liable for providing a refund, a replacement, or repairs.</p>



<p>Impact on Disclaimers</p>



<p>Song-Beverly prohibits disclaimers of implied warranties in many consumer transactions. If a retailer sells new goods in California, the implied warranty of merchantability generally cannot be waived. Sellers can sometimes limit the duration of the implied warranty, but it cannot be shortened to less than 60 days—and that limitation must be set forth conspicuously.</p>



<p>The Act also interacts with any express warranties the seller or manufacturer offers. If an express warranty is provided, the implied warranty cannot be disclaimed. Instead, the implied warranty automatically extends to the same period as the express warranty, up to a maximum of one year. Consequently, disclaimers that attempt to nullify the implied warranty in consumer transactions often violate Song-Beverly.</p>



<p>Failure to Comply</p>



<p>If a seller tries to disclaim warranties in violation of Song-Beverly, or fails to repair or replace a defective consumer good within a reasonable time, the buyer can sue for breach of warranty. Remedies may include a refund, replacement, reimbursement for certain damages, and in some cases, attorney’s fees. Repeated attempts to fix a product that remains defective can also trigger lemon-law remedies, allowing a buyer to demand a full buyback or a replacement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Remedies_for_Breach_of_Warranty"></span>Remedies for Breach of Warranty<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>General Principles</p>



<p>When a seller breaches an express or implied warranty, the buyer is entitled to remedies designed to make them whole. Remedies can include:</p>



<p>• <strong>Damages for Nonconformity</strong>: The difference between the value of the goods as warranted and their actual value when delivered.<br>• <strong>Incidental Damages</strong>: Costs incurred in dealing with the breach, such as expenses for inspection, receipt, transportation, and care of goods rightfully rejected.<br>• <strong>Consequential Damages</strong>: Losses that result from the seller’s breach, including harm to property, lost profits (if foreseeable and provable), or other indirect losses.<br>• <strong>Repair or Replacement</strong>: In some consumer contexts, or by agreement, the seller may be obligated to repair or replace the defective product at no cost.<br>• <strong>Revocation of Acceptance and Rescission</strong>: If the defect substantially impairs the value of the goods, the buyer might revoke acceptance, return the goods, and recover the purchase price.</p>



<p>Limitations or exclusions of certain remedies are permissible in commercial contexts, provided they are not unconscionable or otherwise barred by consumer protection statutes. Clauses that limit consequential damages can be valid, but courts may strike them down if they are found unconscionable, especially where the buyer is left with no meaningful remedy.</p>



<p>Rescission and Revocation of Acceptance</p>



<p>Revocation of acceptance is a powerful remedy under the UCC and California Commercial Code. If a buyer initially accepts goods but later discovers a substantial defect, they can revoke acceptance within a reasonable time if the defect was not discovered due to the seller’s assurances or because the defect was difficult to detect. Revocation returns the parties to a position akin to rejection of goods, allowing the buyer to recover the purchase price and other damages, subject to offset for any use of the goods.</p>



<p>Under consumer statutes, rescission is sometimes even more generous. If a product repeatedly fails despite repair attempts under warranty, the buyer may have a statutory right to replacement or a refund.</p>



<p>Litigation and Burden of Proof</p>



<p>To succeed on a breach of warranty claim, the buyer typically must show:</p>



<p>• A valid warranty existed (express or implied)<br>• The product did not conform to that warranty (it was defective, unfit, or otherwise nonconforming)<br>• The buyer suffered damages as a result of the breach<br>• The buyer notified the seller of the breach within a reasonable time</p>



<p>Under the UCC concept of notice, a buyer generally must inform the seller about the product’s defect and the breach of warranty to preserve the right to sue. Courts usually consider the reasonableness of the time between discovery of the defect and notification, taking into account the type of goods, the buyer’s sophistication, and the nature of the defect.</p>



<p>Sellers can defend themselves by challenging one or more elements of the claim. They might argue no warranty existed, the product conformed to the warranty, the defect was caused by buyer misuse, the buyer failed to provide timely notice, or an effective disclaimer or limitation of liability bars the claim. In many commercial cases, the question of whether disclaimers or exclusions are valid looms large.</p>



<p>Damages in Commercial vs. Consumer Contexts</p>



<p>Commercial transactions often allow parties more freedom to tailor warranties and remedies. Contracts between businesses frequently contain negotiated provisions that limit damages or require alternative dispute resolution. Courts are relatively deferential to these provisions, as long as they are not unconscionable.</p>



<p>In consumer contexts, the parties typically have less bargaining parity, so disclaimers and limitations are restricted by consumer protection statutes. If a seller attempts to disclaim the implied warranty of merchantability in a brand-new product sale to a consumer in California, that disclaimer is likely void under the Song-Beverly Act. If the consumer sues under the Act or Magnuson-Moss, potential outcomes can include restitution, replacement, or repairs, plus possible attorney’s fees.</p>



<p>Privity of Contract</p>



<p>Historically, some courts have required “privity of contract” for a buyer to recover under certain warranties, meaning the buyer must have a direct contractual relationship with the seller. However, modern law, especially in California, has eroded strict privity in many scenarios, particularly with consumer goods and product liability claims. Third-party beneficiaries can sometimes enforce warranties if the warranty is intended to extend to them. In some cases, a subsequent purchaser or a non-purchasing user can claim breach of warranty if the circumstances and statutory provisions support an extension of warranty coverage.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, privity remains relevant for purely contractual claims in some contexts. California has recognized exceptions, especially for products that are dangerous if defective or for consumer goods where the manufacturer’s warranty is intended to protect users, not just the immediate buyer. The ultimate question often becomes whether it is foreseeable and intended that the warranty extend to a person or class of persons who later assert the claim.</p>



<p>Particular Considerations for Manufacturers vs. Retailers</p>



<p>When a defect emerges, the buyer may have claims against both the retailer (direct seller) and the manufacturer. In many consumer goods contexts, the manufacturer issues an express written warranty that runs directly to the consumer. Thus, the consumer can sue the manufacturer for breach of that warranty (or for breach of the implied warranties, if not effectively disclaimed and if permitted by law). Meanwhile, the retailer might face contractual liability if they sold the product to the consumer. Retailers sometimes in turn seek indemnification from the manufacturer.</p>



<p>Song-Beverly imposes obligations on both retailers and manufacturers in consumer transactions, requiring them to honor or enforce the implied warranty of merchantability. If the product is proven defective, both may be on the hook, depending on their contractual arrangements, nature of the defect, and the relevant warranties.</p>



<p>Enforcement Mechanisms and Litigation Strategies</p>



<p>Buyers who suspect they have a warranty claim should gather detailed evidence of the defect, any communications with the seller, and the purchase documents or packaging that set forth express warranties or disclaimers. If the product is expensive or the damages substantial, the buyer may consult with experts to assess whether the defect arises from a design flaw, a manufacturing error, or some other defect that falls within a warranty.</p>



<p>Sellers, on the other hand, will investigate whether the buyer misused the product or disregarded operating instructions. They might also invoke disclaimers or contract provisions limiting liability to repair or replacement. In some cases, the seller may point to disclaimers of implied warranties or argue that the buyer purchased the goods “as is.”</p>



<p>In commercial deals, the language of the sales contract is crucial. Parties commonly detail disclaimers and limitations, along with provisions for inspection and acceptance of goods, notice requirements, and exclusive remedies. Courts typically honor these provisions if they are negotiated by sophisticated parties and are not deemed unconscionable or in violation of specific statutory protections.</p>



<p>Intersection with Tort Liability and Product Liability</p>



<p>Although warranty law is primarily a matter of contract, defective products may also give rise to tort claims such as strict product liability or negligence—especially if the defect causes personal injury or property damage beyond the product itself. Under strict product liability, a manufacturer can be liable even if there was no direct contractual relationship with the injured party, provided the product was unreasonably dangerous. This is a separate track from warranty, although there can be overlap. In California, robust strict liability precedents allow an injured consumer to sue for manufacturing defects, design defects, or inadequate warnings. These claims often proceed on a tort theory rather than breach of warranty.</p>



<p>Product liability tort law can yield broader damages, including pain and suffering or punitive damages if the conduct was egregious, which are typically unavailable in pure contract-based warranty claims. Nevertheless, a buyer who simply wants the defective product fixed or replaced might rely on warranty law for a straightforward path to relief.</p>



<p>Contract Drafting and Risk Mitigation</p>



<p>Businesses that sell goods regularly should pay close attention to their warranty language and disclaimers, particularly when distributing goods in states like California, which offers strong consumer protections. Suppliers can mitigate risk by:</p>



<p>• Drafting clear express warranties that avoid over-promising on performance.<br>• Crafting disclaimers of implied warranties that meet statutory requirements for conspicuousness and specific language (e.g., referencing “merchantability” by name).<br>• Including integration clauses to minimize disputes over oral representations.<br>• Limiting the scope of remedies, if legally permissible, and providing a procedure for repair or replacement.<br>• Ensuring compliance with Magnuson-Moss if providing a written warranty in consumer contexts.<br>• Respecting the Song-Beverly Act’s restrictions on disclaiming warranties for consumer products in California.</p>



<p>On the buyer’s side, reading all warranty terms carefully—and clarifying the seller’s promises in the written agreement—provides the best chance of enforcing them later. If the buyer needs specific performance capabilities beyond the ordinary uses, they should explicitly communicate those needs to the seller, creating grounds for an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Express and implied warranties are at the core of commercial and consumer transactions. They reflect society’s policy that buyers should receive products meeting reasonable standards of quality and that sellers should not profit from undisclosed or latent defects. Express warranties arise from affirmative promises about what a product can do, while implied warranties automatically attach to many sales, ensuring goods are of acceptable quality and suitable for ordinary or specifically disclosed needs.</p>



<p>Under California and federal law, a seller’s obligations can be substantial. Efforts to disclaim or limit warranties are hemmed in by consumer protection statutes such as the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. While commercial sellers often employ disclaimers and limitations of liability in contracts with business buyers, consumer transactions are subject to stricter scrutiny, making many disclaimers unenforceable.</p>



<p>By understanding the interplay between express and implied warranties, buyers and sellers can make informed decisions, draft agreements that accurately reflect their expectations, and address disputes more effectively if something goes wrong. Whenever a product is defective and the buyer has not voluntarily assumed all risk through a valid disclaimer, warranty law ensures that the burden for those defects likely rests on the party who placed the product into the marketplace with that promise of reliability—be it express or implied.</p>
