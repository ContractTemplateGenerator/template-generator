## BUILD PHASES (Revised Dec 2025)

### PHASE 1: California Pillar Pages (CURRENT)
**Goal**: Build CA-specific pillar pages for all high-intent situations

**Strategy**: California-ONLY first. CA pages can rank for both "california X demand letter" AND generic "X demand letter" queries.

**Build order** (by category, 10 pages per batch):

| Batch | Category Focus | Target Pages |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| 1.1 | PI Car Accidents | rear-end, t-bone, multi-vehicle, parking lot, highway, intersection ✅ |
| 1.2 | Mixed High-Priority | breach-of-contract, habitability, lemon-law, defective-product, etc. ✅ |
| 1.3 | PI Expansion | motorcycle, pedestrian, bicycle, slip-fall, premises-liability ✅ |
| 1.4 | Insurance | bad-faith, property-damage, UM/UIM, delayed-payment |
| 1.5 | Employment | discrimination, retaliation, PAGA, meal-break violations |
| 1.6 | Home-Services | contractor-abandonment, solar-fraud, home-warranty ✅ |
| 1.7 | Consumer | CLRA violations, auto-renewal fraud, subscription traps |
| 1.8 | Real-Estate | agent-negligence, title-defect, HOA disputes |

**Completed CA Pillar Pages (48):**
- PI/Car-Accidents: 9 pages (rear-end, t-bone, multi-vehicle, parking-lot, highway, intersection, sideswipe, rollover, uber-lyft)
- PI/root: 13 pages (motorcycle, pedestrian, bicycle, grocery-slip-fall, premises-liability, etc.)
- Employment: 6 pages (wages, overtime, harassment, discrimination, wrongful-termination, personnel-file)
- Insurance: 2 pages (bad-faith, property-damage)
- Others: 18 pages across Business, Consumer, Landlord-Tenant, Real-Estate, Automotive, Home-Services, Medical

### PHASE 2: Category Deepening
**Goal**: Get every category to 10+ CA pillar pages

**Priority gaps:**
| Category | Current CA | Target | Gap |
|----------|-----------|--------|-----|
| Insurance | 2 | 10 | +8 |
| Business | 1 | 8 | +7 |
| Consumer | 2 | 8 | +6 |
| Landlord-Tenant | 2 | 8 | +6 |
| Real-Estate | 2 | 6 | +4 |
| Medical | 1 | 5 | +4 |

### PHASE 3: Respond-Side Parity
**Goal**: Build respond/defense guides for each write-side page

**Two-sided coverage priority:**
| Write Side | Respond Side | Status |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Employment claims | Employer responses | Partial |
| Business demands | Business defense | Partial |
| Landlord claims | Tenant responses | Partial |
| Tenant claims | Landlord responses | Partial |
| Consumer claims | Business/seller responses | Light |
| PI demands | Insurance/defendant responses | Light |

### PHASE 4: Spanish Language Expansion
**Goal**: 50+ Spanish pages targeting high-volume consumer issues

**Target clusters:**
- Landlord-tenant (deposits, habitability) - "inquilino-propietario"
- Employment (wages, discrimination) - "empleo"
- Consumer fraud (cars, contractors) - "consumidor"
- Personal injury basics - "lesiones-personales"

### PHASE 5: State Expansion (AZ, NV, OR)
**Goal**: Adapt top 30 CA pages for each neighboring state

**Priority states:**
| State | Priority | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Arizona (AZ) | HIGH | Borders CA, Phoenix market |
| Nevada (NV) | HIGH | Las Vegas market, CA ties |
| Oregon (OR) | HIGH | Portland market, tech overlap |

### PHASE 6: Generator Module Expansion (DEFERRED)
**Goal**: Add situation modules to generator for pages that don't have them

**Current generator supports only:**
- `unpaid-wages` ✅
- `breach-of-contract` ✅
- `security-deposit` ✅
- `unpaid-invoice` ✅

**Deferred until**: Core CA pillar content is complete. Sample Language sections in pillar pages provide sufficient user value without generator.

**Future modules to add:**
- car-accident
- habitability
- bad-faith-insurance
- discrimination
- lemon-law
- contractor-dispute

---

## PAGE TEMPLATE: CA Pillar Page Format

Each California pillar page includes:

1. **Mega Header** - Site-wide navigation
2. **Hero Section** - Title, subtitle, key stats (statute, penalties, deadline)
3. **Breadcrumb** - Category > Subcategory > Page
4. **Sticky Sidebar** - 7-8 section links + CTA
5. **Main Content Sections:**
   - Overview
   - Legal Basis (CA statutes, case law)
   - Elements/Requirements
   - Damages & Penalties
   - Evidence Checklist (interactive)
   - Sample Language (copy-paste paragraphs)
   - Next Steps
6. **Footer** - Terms.Law links

**NO generator iframe** unless situation module exists in `/generator/`.
