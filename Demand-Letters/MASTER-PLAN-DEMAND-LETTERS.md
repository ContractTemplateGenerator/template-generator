## BUILD PHASES (Revised Priority Order)

### PHASE 1: Category Deepening (Current Priority)
**Goal**: Get every category to 15+ pages before expanding to new languages/states

**Rationale**: Build the English content base first. Google indexes new pages gradually. While indexing happens, we deepen and refine. State/Spanish versions are adaptations of existing content—they require the base content to exist first.

**Priority gaps to fill:**
| Category | Current | Target | Gap |
|----------|---------|--------|-----|
| Insurance | 6 | 15+ | +9 |
| Real-Estate | 5 | 12+ | +7 |
| Automotive | 6 | 12+ | +6 |
| Home-Services | 7 | 15+ | +8 |
| Animals | 4 | 10+ | +6 |
| Licensing | 4 | 10+ | +6 |

### PHASE 2: Personal Injury Blitz
**Goal**: Expand PI from 23 pages to 50+ pages

**High-value subclusters:**
- Car accidents (rear-end, T-bone, multi-vehicle, highway, parking lot, intersection)
- Motorcycle & bicycle accidents
- Pedestrian accidents (crosswalk, jaywalking, e-scooter)
- Premises liability (retail, hotel, apartment, restaurant, gym)
- Dog bites (by breed, by location, insurance issues)
- Medical malpractice (misdiagnosis, surgical errors, medication errors)
- Product liability (defective products, recalls, manufacturing defects)
- Wrongful death (by cause, by relationship, damages calculation)

### PHASE 3: Respond-Side Parity
**Goal**: Audit existing write-side pages, build respond mirrors, cross-link

**Process:**
1. **Audit** - Scan each category folder for pages without respond counterparts
2. **Build mirrors** - Create respond-side content for each orphaned write page
3. **Cross-link** - Add Write↔Respond links on both sides
4. **Use unified toggle** - Implement iframe/modal toggle so users can switch Write/Respond without leaving the page

**Two-sided coverage priority:**
| Write Side | Respond Side | Status |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Employment claims | Employer responses | Partial |
| Business demands | Business defense | Partial |
| Landlord claims | Tenant responses | Partial |
| Tenant claims | Landlord responses | Partial |
| Consumer claims | Business/seller responses | Light |
| PI demands | Insurance/defendant responses | Light |

### PHASE 4: Generator Rollout
**Goal**: Add interactive generators to top 100 pages

**Priority order based on traffic:**
- Top 20 pages → Advanced contenteditable generators
- Top 50 pages → Lightweight snippet generators
- Remaining → Keep widget playbook (tabs + checklist + FAQ)

**Reference implementation**: `california/saas-termination-dispute-demand-letters.html`

### PHASE 5: Spanish Language Expansion
**Goal**: 100+ Spanish pages targeting high-volume consumer issues

**Why Phase 5 (not earlier)**: Spanish pages are adaptations of English content. Build the English base first, then translate/adapt. This also gives time for English pages to start ranking before we expand.

**Target subclusters:**
- Landlord-tenant (deposits, habitability, evictions) - "inquilino-propietario"
- Employment (wages, discrimination, termination) - "empleo"
- Consumer fraud (cars, contractors) - "consumidor"
- Debt collection defense - "deudas"
- Personal injury basics - "lesiones-personales"

**Spanish SEO keywords:**
- "carta de demanda" (demand letter)
- "carta de reclamo" (complaint letter)
- "derechos del inquilino" (tenant rights)
- "salarios no pagados" (unpaid wages)
- "accidente de auto reclamo" (car accident claim)

### PHASE 6: State Expansion (AZ, NV, OR)
**Goal**: Adapt top 30-50 pages for each neighboring state

**Why Phase 6 (last)**: State versions require the base content to exist. They're systematic adaptations—update statutes, adjust court procedures, keep same structure. Best done as a batch operation after core content is mature.

**Priority states (geographic credibility):**
| State | Priority | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Arizona (AZ) | HIGH | Borders CA, large population, Phoenix market |
| Nevada (NV) | HIGH | Borders CA, Las Vegas market, many CA ties |
| Oregon (OR) | HIGH | Borders CA, Portland market, tech overlap |

**Folder structure:**
```
Demand-Letters/
├── Arizona/
├── Nevada/
├── Oregon/
├── Spanish/
```

## INTERACTIVE GENERATORS

### Generator Architecture: Modular Modal Approach

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT build full generators from scratch for each page. Use the centralized generator with modals.

**Core Generator**: `generator/index.html`
- Two-panel layout with inline editing
- State modules (CA, TX, NY, FL - expandable)
- Situation modules (wages, contracts, deposits, invoices - expandable)
- URL parameter support: `?state=california&situation=unpaid-wages`
- Copy, Print, Download .doc functionality

**Per-Page Integration (lightweight modal)**:
```html
<!-- Add to any demand letter page -->
<button onclick="openGenerator('california', 'unpaid-wages')">Generate My Letter</button>

<div id="generatorModal" class="generator-modal">
  <div class="modal-content">
    <button class="close-btn" onclick="closeGenerator()">&times;</button>
    <iframe id="generatorFrame" src=""></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

<script>
function openGenerator(state, situation) {
  document.getElementById('generatorFrame').src =
    '../generator/?state=' + state + '&situation=' + situation;
  document.getElementById('generatorModal').style.display = 'flex';
}
function closeGenerator() {
  document.getElementById('generatorModal').style.display = 'none';
}
</script>
```

**This approach means**:
- Generator updates happen in ONE place (`generator/index.html`)
- Adding new situations = update SituationModules object only
- Adding new states = update StateModules object only
- 500+ pages get ~15 lines of modal code, not 1,600+ lines of duplicate generator

### Current State/Situation Coverage

**States Available**: California, Texas, New York, Florida

**Situations Available**:
- `unpaid-wages` - Employment wages
- `breach-of-contract` - Business contracts
- `security-deposit` - Landlord-tenant deposits
- `unpaid-invoice` - Business invoices

### Expansion Roadmap

**Priority situations to add**:
1. Car accident injury (PI)
2. Habitability complaints (Landlord-Tenant)
3. Consumer refund (Consumer)
4. Discrimination/harassment (Employment)
5. Insurance bad faith (Insurance)

## UNIFIED VARIANT TOGGLE ARCHITECTURE

### The Vision: One Page, Multiple Variants

Instead of separate URLs for Write/Respond and English/Russian/Spanish, use **inline toggles** that load variant content into the same page frame without navigation.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Unpaid Wages Demand Letter                             │
│  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────│
│  [✓ Write] [ Respond ]     [ EN ] [ RU ] [ ES ]        │
│  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────│
│                                                         │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │                                                 │   │
│  │   (Content loads here via iframe/AJAX)         │   │
│  │                                                 │   │
│  │   Current: Write-side, English                 │   │
│  │                                                 │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Benefits

1. **One canonical URL** - SEO juice stays concentrated
2. **No page reload** - Fast UX, user doesn't lose scroll position
3. **Easier maintenance** - Shell page is lightweight, variants are modular
4. **Reduced file count** - 1 shell + 6 variants vs 6 separate full pages

### Implementation

**Shell page** (the canonical URL):
- Header, navigation, CTAs, footer
- Toggle buttons for Write/Respond
- Toggle buttons for EN/RU/ES
- iframe or div for variant content

**Variant content files** (loaded into frame):
- `_write-en.html` - Write-side English
- `_respond-en.html` - Respond-side English
- `_write-ru.html` - Write-side Russian
- `_respond-ru.html` - Respond-side Russian
- `_write-es.html` - Write-side Spanish
- `_respond-es.html` - Respond-side Spanish

**Toggle logic**:
```javascript
function loadVariant(side, lang) {
  const src = `./_${side}-${lang}.html`;
  document.getElementById('variantFrame').src = src;
  // Update toggle button states
  // Update URL hash for bookmarking: #respond-ru
}
```

### Rollout Priority

1. **Phase 3** - Implement for Write↔Respond toggles on new respond-side pages
2. **Phase 5** - Add language toggles when Spanish content is built
3. **Retrofit** - Gradually update existing Russian pages to use toggle architecture

7. Build Spanish hub with 50 core pages
8. Adapt top 30 pages for AZ/NV/OR

---

## CLUSTER KIT METHODOLOGY

**UPDATED DEC 2025: CA-FIRST STRATEGY**

Build CALIFORNIA-ONLY pillar pages first. Avoids Google duplicate content flags for a new domain.

**Why CA-Only First:**
- You're a CA-licensed attorney = strongest moat, highest E-E-A-T
- New domains need trust - general + state pages look like thin content farming
- CA pages can rank for BOTH "california X demand letter" AND "X demand letter"
- Generator handles all 6 states automatically via URL params - no separate pages needed yet

For each high-intent cluster, build:

1. **CA Pillar Page** - California-specific with statutes, case law, penalties (7-tab format)
2. **Generator Module** - Situation module with all 6 states (CA, AZ, NV, OR, WA, Other)
3. **Respond guide** - for recipients of such letters
4. **Cross-links** - to related CA pillar pages

**PHASE 6+ (FUTURE):** General/all-states pages after CA pages are indexed and ranking.
