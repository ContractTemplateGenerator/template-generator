- Motivated (something went wrong)
- Time-sensitive (deadlines, statutes of limitation)
- Convertible (willing to pay for professional help)

**Current Status**: 377 pages live, covering 25+ categories

**Competitive Moat**: CA Attorney + Scale + Interactive Generators + Bilingual (Russian) + Multi-State Expansion

## INTERACTIVE GENERATORS

### Generator Architecture

Advanced generators use the **two-panel layout with inline editing**:
- Left panel: Form inputs
- Right panel: Live preview with `contenteditable="true"` fields
- Users can edit directly in the preview
- Copy, Print, Download .doc functionality

### Pages with Advanced Generators

**California SaaS Cluster** (5 pages with contenteditable generators):
- `california/saas-sla-breach-demand-letters.html`
- `california/saas-subscription-refund-demand-letters.html`
- `california/saas-api-access-demand-letters.html`
- `california/unpaid-invoice-collection-demand-letters.html`
- `california/saas-termination-dispute-demand-letters.html` ← BEST EXAMPLE

**PI Car Accidents**:
- `PI/Car-Accidents/california-uber-lyft-rideshare-demand-letters.html`

**Main Generator**:
- `generator/index.html` (standalone generator tool)

**Animals** (3 pages with basic generators):
- `Animals/veterinary-malpractice-demand-letters.html`
- `Animals/pet-grooming-boarding-negligence-demand-letters.html`
- `Animals/pet-purchase-dispute-sick-puppy-demand-letters.html`

### Generator Template Reference

Use `california/saas-termination-dispute-demand-letters.html` as the reference implementation:
- `genH()` helper function for highlighted fields
- `genSetupInlineEditing()` for contenteditable sync
- Print/Copy/Download buttons
- Dynamic letter generation based on form inputs

---

## STANDARD FEE STRUCTURE

All demand letter pages should display:

- **Hourly rate**: $240/hr
- **Demand letters**: $450 flat fee (base starting point)
- **Contingency**: 33-40% of recovery
- **Case evaluation**: Paid consultation

**DO NOT** use ranges like "$300-$500/hr" or "$800-$1,500" for demand letters.

---

## STATE EXPANSION STRATEGY

### Priority 1: Neighboring States (Geographic Credibility)

Expand to states that are geographically close to California. It's credible for a CA lawyer to work with clients in neighboring states.

| State | Priority | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Arizona (AZ)** | HIGH | Borders CA, large population, Phoenix/Scottsdale market |
| **Nevada (NV)** | HIGH | Borders CA, Las Vegas market, many CA ties |
| **Oregon (OR)** | HIGH | Borders CA, Portland market, tech industry overlap |

### Priority 2: Future Expansion

| State | Priority | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Washington (WA) | Medium | Seattle tech market, Pacific Northwest corridor |
| Colorado (CO) | Medium | Denver market, growing tech hub |
| Texas (TX) | Lower | Large but geographically distant from CA base |
| New York (NY) | Lower | Major market but too far - weak positioning for CA attorney |
| Florida (FL) | Lower | Major market but too far - weak positioning for CA attorney |

### State-Specific Page Strategy

For each neighboring state (AZ, NV, OR):
1. Adapt top 10-15 California demand letter pages
2. Update state-specific statutes and citations
3. Adjust court procedures and timelines
4. Keep same fee structure
5. Create state subfolder: `Demand-Letters/Arizona/`, `Demand-Letters/Nevada/`, `Demand-Letters/Oregon/`
