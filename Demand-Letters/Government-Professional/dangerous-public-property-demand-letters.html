<div class="section-title">Legal Standards</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">California Government Liability (Gov. Code § 835)</div>

<div class="info-box">
<p>A public entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if:</p>
<ol class="styled-list">
<li>Property was in dangerous condition at time of injury</li>
<li>Injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition</li>
<li>Dangerous condition created reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury incurred</li>
<li>Either: (a) negligent act of employee created condition, OR (b) entity had notice and time to protect against it</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">"Dangerous Condition" Defined</div>

<p>A condition that creates a substantial (not minor or trivial) risk of injury when property is used with due care in a manner reasonably foreseeable.</p>

<p><strong>The "Trivial Defect" Defense:</strong> Governments often argue small defects (under 1") are "trivial" and not dangerous as a matter of law. Courts consider:</p>

<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Size of defect (but no minimum threshold)</li>
<li>Nature of defect (jagged vs. smooth edges)</li>
<li>Weather/lighting conditions</li>
<li>Whether defect was visible</li>
<li>Pedestrian traffic in area</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Notice Requirements</div>

<p>You must prove the government had notice of the dangerous condition:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Type of Notice</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>How to Prove</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Actual Notice</strong></td>
<td>Government actually knew about hazard</td>
<td>Prior complaints, inspection reports, work orders, 311 reports</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Constructive Notice</strong></td>
<td>Condition existed long enough that government should have known</td>
<td>Expert testimony on how long defect existed; evidence of routine inspections</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Created Condition</strong></td>
<td>Government employee created the hazard</td>
<td>Evidence of work done, employee records</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="section-subtitle">Immunities & Exceptions</div>

<p>Governments have immunities that may apply:</p>

<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Design immunity:</strong> If condition resulted from approved design, may be immune (but not if condition changed)</li>
<li><strong>Natural conditions:</strong> Generally no liability for natural hazards (but maintenance duties may apply)</li>
<li><strong>Third-party acts:</strong> May not be liable for hazards created solely by third parties (exceptions apply)</li>
<li><strong>Weather:</strong> Temporary weather conditions (but failure to respond may create liability)</li>

<div class="section-subtitle">Public Records Requests</div>

<p>You can request government records under state public records acts:</p>

<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>California:</strong> California Public Records Act (Gov. Code § 6250 et seq.)</li>
<li><strong>Federal:</strong> FOIA for federal property</li>
<li><strong>Request:</strong> Inspection reports, maintenance logs, prior incident reports, 311 complaints for the location</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>⚠️ Governments May Repair Quickly:</strong> After an injury report, governments often repair hazards immediately. Return to photograph the location as soon as possible - before repairs destroy evidence.
