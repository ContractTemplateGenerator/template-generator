```

### The Ontology (How We Avoid Duplicate Content)

Every page must be unique across these dimensions:

1. **Dispute Archetype**: Nonpayment, Defect, Denial, Breach, Freeze, Termination, Infringement
2. **Relationship**: Consumer↔Merchant, Tenant↔Landlord, Employee↔Employer, B2B, Platform↔User
3. **Forum Path**: Chargeback, Agency, Small Claims, Arbitration, Federal Court, Self-Help
4. **Evidence Regime**: What documents prove this specific claim
5. **Remedy Structure**: Statutory penalties, Interest, Multipliers, Fees
6. **Timeline Constraints**: SOL variations, Demand deadline norms, Filing deadlines

**Rule**: A new page only exists if it differs on at least 2 of these 6 dimensions.

## PART 4: ANTI-DUPLICATE VALIDATION SYSTEM

### The Uniqueness Algorithm

For every page generated, Agent 5 runs this validation:

```python
def validate_uniqueness(new_page, existing_pages):
    """
    A page is unique if it differs on at least 2 ontology dimensions
    """
    dimensions_checked = [
        'dispute_archetype',      # Nonpayment vs Defect vs Breach etc.
        'relationship_type',      # B2B vs Consumer vs Employment etc.
        'forum_path',            # Small claims vs Arbitration vs Agency
        'evidence_regime',       # What documents are required
        'remedy_structure',      # Statutory penalties vs contract damages
        'jurisdiction_overlay'   # Does state law meaningfully differ?
    ]
    
    differences = 0
    for dimension in dimensions_checked:
        if new_page[dimension] != existing_pages.similar_page[dimension]:
            differences += 1
    
    if differences >= 2:
        return "UNIQUE - Publish"
    else:
        return "DUPLICATE RISK - Merge or differentiate"
```

### Content Uniqueness Checks

1. **First 200 words must be unique** (checked via similarity score)
2. **At least 3 unique statute/code citations** (vs similar pages)
3. **Evidence checklist differs by at least 40%** (from similar scenarios)
4. **Defenses section includes scenario-specific analysis** (not just universal defenses)
5. **Forum analysis explains why X over Y** (scenario-specific reasoning)

### SEO Validation Checklist

Every page must have:
- [ ] Unique H1 (max 70 chars)
- [ ] Unique meta description (140-160 chars)
- [ ] Unique title tag (50-60 chars)
- [ ] Primary keyword in first 100 words
- [ ] Secondary keywords in H2s
- [ ] At least 1,200 words of unique content
- [ ] Internal links to 6+ related pages
- [ ] External citations to authoritative sources
- [ ] Schema markup (Article, FAQPage, or HowTo)
- [ ] Author byline with credentials
- [ ] Last updated date

---

## PART 5: THE UNFAIR ADVANTAGES (That $20/Month Can't Build)

### 1. Multi-Factor Intelligence Engine

**What it is**: Not just "select your dispute type" but a weighted scoring system.

**How it works**:
```javascript
function calculateSuccessProbability(inputs) {
    let baseScore = 50;
    
    // Amount at stake
    if (inputs.amount < 500) baseScore -= 10;
    if (inputs.amount > 10000) baseScore += 15;
    
    // Evidence quality
    if (inputs.evidence === 'strong') baseScore += 25;
    if (inputs.evidence === 'some') baseScore += 10;
    if (inputs.evidence === 'weak') baseScore -= 15;
    
    // Timeline
    if (inputs.daysOld < 30) baseScore += 10;
    if (inputs.daysOld > 365) baseScore -= 15;
    if (inputs.daysOld > 730) baseScore -= 30; // SOL risk
    
    // Written agreement
    if (inputs.writtenContract) baseScore += 20;
    if (inputs.arbitrationClause) baseScore += 15; // Enforcement easier
    
    // Opponent type
    if (inputs.opponentType === 'platform') baseScore += 10; // Policy leverage
    if (inputs.opponentType === 'individual') baseScore -= 5; // Collection risk
    
    // Jurisdiction advantages
    if (inputs.jurisdiction === 'CA' && inputs.scenarioType === 'wages') {
        baseScore += 20; // CA wage laws very pro-employee
    }
    
    // Attorney involvement
    if (inputs.requestedTier === 'premium') baseScore += 25;
    if (inputs.requestedTier === 'letterhead') baseScore += 15;
    
    return Math.min(95, Math.max(5, baseScore));
}
```

**Why it's unfair**: Basic tools can't do weighted multi-factor analysis. This demonstrates legal expertise via algorithm.

---

### 2. Jurisdiction-Aware Calculations

**What it is**: Settlement calculators that know state-specific multipliers and penalties.

**Example: California Unpaid Wages**
```javascript
function calculateCAWageDemand(baseWages, daysUnpaid, dailyRate) {
    let demand = {
        base: baseWages,
        penalties: 0,
        waitingTime: 0,
        interest: 0,
        fees: 0
    };
    
    // Labor Code § 203 - Waiting Time Penalties (up to 30 days)
    const waitingDays = Math.min(30, daysUnpaid);
    demand.waitingTime = waitingDays * dailyRate;
    
    // Labor Code § 1194 - Liquidated Damages (unpaid OT only)
    if (includesOT) {
        demand.penalties = baseWages; // 1x the unpaid OT
    }
    
    // PAGA Penalties (if applicable)
    if (isPAGAEligible) {
        demand.penalties += 100 * numberOfViolations; // $100/violation initial
        demand.penalties += 200 * numberOfViolations; // $200/violation subsequent
    }
    
    // Interest (10% per CA law)
    demand.interest = (baseWages + demand.penalties) * 0.10 * (daysUnpaid / 365);
    
    // Attorney fees (if statute allows)
    demand.fees = (demand.base + demand.penalties + demand.waitingTime) * 0.33;
    
    return {
        totalDemand: demand.base + demand.penalties + demand.waitingTime + 
                     demand.interest + demand.fees,
        breakdown: demand,
        statutes: [
            'Labor Code § 203 (waiting time)',
            'Labor Code § 1194 (liquidated damages)',
            'Labor Code § 2699 (PAGA penalties)',
            'Civil Code § 3287 (prejudgment interest)'
        ]
    };
}
```

**Why it's unfair**: This requires actual legal knowledge of state-specific statutes, penalties, and case law. ChatGPT can't reliably do this without hallucinating.

---

### 3. Evidence Weighting System

**What it is**: Each piece of evidence gets a weighted score based on admissibility, persuasiveness, and forum.

**Example**:
```javascript
const evidenceWeights = {
    'written_contract': {
        admissibility: 95,
        persuasiveness: 90,
        forumModifiers: {
            'small_claims': 1.0,
            'arbitration': 1.1,
            'court': 1.2
        }
    },
    'email_trail': {
        admissibility: 85,
        persuasiveness: 70,
        forumModifiers: {
            'small_claims': 1.0,
            'arbitration': 0.9,
            'court': 0.8  // Hearsay issues
        }
    },
    'witness_statements': {
        admissibility: 70,
        persuasiveness: 60,
        forumModifiers: {
            'small_claims': 0.8,  // Witnesses often don't show
            'arbitration': 0.9,
            'court': 1.0
        }
    },
    'photos_video': {
        admissibility: 95,
        persuasiveness: 85,
        forumModifiers: {
            'small_claims': 1.1,  // Very persuasive to judges
            'arbitration': 1.0,
            'court': 1.0
        }
    },
    'expert_report': {
        admissibility: 90,
        persuasiveness: 95,
        forumModifiers: {
            'small_claims': 0.7,  // Often excluded
            'arbitration': 1.1,
            'court': 1.3
        }
    }
};

function calculateEvidenceStrength(userEvidence, intendedForum) {
    let totalScore = 0;
    let maxPossible = 0;
    
    for (let evidenceType in evidenceWeights) {
        const weight = evidenceWeights[evidenceType];
        const forumMod = weight.forumModifiers[intendedForum];
        const score = (weight.admissibility + weight.persuasiveness) / 2 * forumMod;
        
        maxPossible += score;
        
        if (userEvidence.includes(evidenceType)) {
            totalScore += score;
        }
    }
    
    return {
        score: Math.round((totalScore / maxPossible) * 100),
        recommendation: totalScore / maxPossible > 0.7 ? 'DIY viable' : 'Attorney recommended'
    };
}
```

**Why it's unfair**: This is actual legal analysis of evidence strength, forum-specific admissibility, and strategic value. Can't be replicated with simple AI.

### 4. Platform Policy Cross-Reference Engine

**What it is**: NLP analysis of suspension notices matched against actual TOS with gap identification.

**How it works**:
```javascript
async function analyzePlatformNotice(noticeText, platform) {
    // Step 1: Extract claimed violation
    const violation = await extractViolation(noticeText);
    // Example: "Your account has been suspended for high chargeback rate"
    
    // Step 2: Pull actual TOS language for this platform
    const tosDatabase = await loadPlatformTOS(platform);
    const relevantClause = findRelevantClause(tosDatabase, violation.type);
    
    // Step 3: Cross-reference
    const analysis = {
        claimed: violation.description,
        actualTOS: relevantClause.text,
        requirements: relevantClause.requirements,
        gaps: [],
        counterarguments: []
    };
    
    // Step 4: Identify gaps
    // Example: TOS says "above 1% for 2 consecutive months"
    // But user's rate was 0.8% with one spike
    if (violation.metric && relevantClause.threshold) {
        if (violation.metric < relevantClause.threshold) {
            analysis.gaps.push({
                type: 'threshold_not_met',
                explanation: `TOS requires ${relevantClause.threshold}, your rate was ${violation.metric}`
            });
        }
    }
    
    // Check notice requirements
    if (relevantClause.requiresNotice && !violation.noticeProvided) {
        analysis.gaps.push({
            type: 'procedural_violation',
            explanation: `TOS §${relevantClause.section} requires ${relevantClause.noticeDays}-day notice. No notice was provided.`
        });
    }
    
    // Step 5: Generate counter-arguments
    analysis.counterarguments = generateCounterArguments(analysis.gaps, tosDatabase);
    
    // Step 6: Draft response template
    analysis.responseTemplate = generateResponseTemplate(analysis);
    
    return analysis;
}
```

**Why it's unfair**: Requires (1) comprehensive TOS database for every platform, (2) NLP to extract violations, (3) Legal reasoning to identify exploitable gaps, (4) Template generation. Way beyond basic AI.

### 5. Dynamic Page Assembly

**What it is**: Instead of 10,000 static pages, build smart templates that pull modules based on scenario.

**How it works**:
```javascript
function assemblePage(scenario) {
    const page = {
        header: universalHeader,
        navigation: universalNav,
        h1: generateH1(scenario),
        overview: generateOverview(scenario),
        legalFramework: getLegalFramework(scenario),
        evidenceSection: getEvidenceModule(scenario),
        defensesSection: getDefensesModule(scenario),
        strategySection: getStrategyModule(scenario),
        escalationSection: getEscalationModule(scenario),
        toolsSection: getRelevantTools(scenario),
        internalLinks: generateInternalLinks(scenario),
        ctaSection: getApproppriateCTA(scenario),
        footer: universalFooter
    };
    
    return renderPage(page);
}

function getEvidenceModule(scenario) {
    // Pull scenario-specific evidence from database
    const baseEvidence = evidenceDatabase[scenario.archetype];
    const jurisdictionOverlay = evidenceDatabase[scenario.jurisdiction];
    const forumRequirements = evidenceDatabase[scenario.intendedForum];
    
    return merge(baseEvidence, jurisdictionOverlay, forumRequirements);
}
```

**Why it's unfair**: This requires sophisticated content management, database architecture, and rendering logic. Creates millions of possible combinations from hundreds of modules.
