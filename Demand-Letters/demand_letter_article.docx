When Does a Demand Letter Become Extortion or Defamation? Staying on the Right Side of the Law

Most lawyers have sent demand letters that make recipients uncomfortable. That's often the point—you're trying to get someone's attention and resolve a dispute without litigation. But there's a line between aggressive advocacy and criminal conduct, and crossing it can destroy your career, your license, and possibly land you in prison.

I've reviewed hundreds of demand letters over the years, from the professionally sharp to the catastrophically stupid. Some were masterclasses in persuasion. Others were ticking time bombs that could have gotten their authors disbarred or prosecuted. The difference often comes down to a single paragraph, sometimes a single sentence.

Let me walk you through where that line is, using real cases and practical examples that show exactly when a hardball letter becomes an illegal threat.

The Lawyer Who Threatened to Go to the Press

In 2006, the California Supreme Court decided Flatley v. Mauro, a case that should be required reading for anyone who drafts demand letters. A high-profile attorney named Martin Singer represented a woman who claimed a famous dancer had sexually assaulted her. Singer sent the dancer a demand letter seeking a seven-figure settlement.

Here's what made this letter catastrophically problematic: Singer didn't just threaten to file a lawsuit. He explicitly stated that if the dancer didn't pay, his client would simultaneously file suit and launch a media campaign—press releases to major news outlets, public statements, the works. The letter essentially said: "Pay us or we'll destroy your reputation in the court of public opinion."

The California Supreme Court held this was criminal extortion as a matter of law. Not a close call. Not subject to interpretation. Criminal. The court stripped away the anti-SLAPP protections that normally shield litigation-related conduct and found that the litigation privilege didn't apply because the letter was fundamentally an illegal threat.

What made Singer's letter cross the line? It wasn't the aggressive tone or the large settlement demand. It was the explicit threat to use publicity as a weapon in exchange for money. The combination of "pay us X dollars" plus "or we'll destroy you in the press" mapped directly onto California's extortion statute.

Compare that to another Martin Singer letter a few years later in Malin v. Singer. This one was also aggressive, also mentioned potentially embarrassing facts, but framed everything in terms of what would come out through litigation. The trial court initially thought it looked like extortion, but the Court of Appeal reversed. The key difference? Singer didn't threaten independent publicity or reporting to authorities. He explained what his client would pursue through civil litigation, which is exactly what demand letters are supposed to do.

These two cases create bookends: Malin shows you can be aggressive about litigation; Flatley shows you can't use threats of publicity, criminal prosecution, or regulatory reporting as bargaining chips.

The Anatomy of Extortion

California Penal Code Section 518 defines extortion as obtaining property or other consideration from another with their consent, induced by wrongful use of force or fear. Section 519 lists the types of "fear" that qualify:

- Threat to do unlawful injury to person or property
- Threat to accuse someone of a crime
- Threat to expose a secret or disgrace someone
- Threat to expose someone's immigration status

When you draft a demand letter, you're inherently creating some level of pressure. That's fine—even desirable. The question is what kind of pressure. Threatening civil litigation? Generally fine. Threatening to report someone to the police, the IRS, immigration authorities, or their licensing board unless they pay you? That's textbook extortion.

I once reviewed a demand letter from an out-of-state attorney who wrote: "My client is prepared to file a civil suit for fraud and breach of contract. Additionally, if this matter is not resolved within ten days, we will be reporting your client's conduct to the District Attorney's office, the State Bar, and the IRS." The letter then demanded $500,000 to settle.

This is the kind of letter that keeps malpractice insurers awake at night. It takes multiple potential extortion threats and ties them directly to a payment demand. Even if every allegation was true—and truth is not a defense to extortion—the structure screams "pay us or we'll ruin your life through channels that have nothing to do with our civil claims."

The attorney genuinely didn't understand the problem. He thought he was being thorough by listing all the ways his client could pursue remedies. What he actually created was a confession to attempted extortion, helpfully reduced to writing and sent via traceable means.

The Civil Side: When Pressure Becomes Duress

Extortion isn't just a criminal issue. California Civil Code Section 1570 defines "menace" as a threat of unlawful and violent injury, or injury to someone's character. Section 1689 allows rescission of any contract obtained through menace or duress.

A recent case, Tran v. Nguyen (2023), involved a man who agreed to pay his former lover $50,000 after she threatened to reveal to his wife and family that he had fathered a secret child. He paid, then sued to get his money back. The Court of Appeal held that the threat to expose his secret—which would damage his reputation and family relationships—constituted "menace" under California law, and he could rescind the agreement and recover his payment.

This matters for demand letters because even if prosecutors never file charges, a recipient who pays under what they claim was duress can come back later seeking rescission, restitution, and possibly civil extortion damages. The civil claim doesn't require as much proof as criminal prosecution, and plaintiffs' attorneys love these cases because they can point to your own letter as evidence.

I've seen defendants successfully argue duress when they paid after receiving letters that said things like: "Settle now or we will make sure your customers know about this fraud," or "Pay within 48 hours or we're contacting your wife about your affair." Courts take a dim view of using personal secrets or business reputation as leverage for unrelated payment demands.

The Defamation Trap

While extortion is the nuclear risk, defamation is the more common one. Most demand letters make allegations about someone's conduct—that's necessary to establish why your client deserves payment. But there's a critical difference between stating allegations as part of a legal claim and making factual accusations that damage someone's reputation.

Imagine you're drafting a demand letter about a breach of contract. Here are two ways to describe the same facts:

Version A: "Your client is a fraud who lies to customers, steals their money, and runs a criminal enterprise masquerading as a legitimate business."

Version B: "Based on the evidence we've gathered, including emails, contracts, and witness statements, we believe your client's conduct constitutes breach of contract and fraud under California Civil Code Section 1709. Specifically, [list factual allegations]."

Version A is asking for a defamation counterclaim. It makes broad character judgments ("fraud," "lies," "criminal enterprise") without factual support or legal context. Version B describes the same conduct but frames it as legal allegations supported by evidence.

The litigation privilege under California Civil Code Section 47(b) provides broad protection for communications made in connection with judicial proceedings or in serious contemplation of litigation. This means properly drafted demand letters usually can't support defamation claims—the privilege is absolute in California for communications to parties or potential parties about contemplated litigation.

But the privilege isn't unlimited. It doesn't protect:

- Communications to third parties who aren't involved in the dispute (like sending copies to someone's employer, customers, or family)
- Statements made to the media or posted publicly
- Criminal conduct like extortion

In Rothman v. Jackson, the California Court of Appeal held that statements to the press—even about ongoing litigation—aren't protected by the litigation privilege because they're not "functionally related" to the litigation itself. You're not trying to resolve the case; you're trying to damage someone's reputation publicly.

The practical lesson: send your demand letter to the opposing party or their counsel only. The moment you CC their boss, their customers, the local newspaper, or anyone else, you've potentially waived privilege and created defamation exposure. And if your letter includes personal attacks rather than factual allegations, the privilege may not save you anyway.

The Ethics Rules: What Your State Bar Prohibits

Even if you avoid criminal extortion and civil defamation, you can still lose your law license for threatening criminal prosecution to gain advantage in a civil matter.

California Rule of Professional Conduct 3.10 states: "A lawyer shall not threaten to present criminal, administrative, or disciplinary charges to obtain an advantage in a civil dispute."

The Comment explains the rule this way: You can inform someone that you intend to report apparent criminal conduct, and you can do so regardless of whether they settle. But you cannot condition reporting on settlement, or suggest that you'll refrain from reporting if they pay you.

Here's the distinction in practice:

Acceptable: "Your conduct appears to violate Penal Code Section X. My client reserves all rights to report this matter to appropriate authorities and to pursue civil remedies."

Prohibited: "My client will file a police report about your apparent violation of Penal Code Section X unless you settle this civil matter for $100,000 within ten days."

The first version acknowledges potential criminal conduct but doesn't use it as leverage. The second explicitly conditions reporting on payment—textbook Rule 3.10 violation.

Most states have similar rules, often derived from the old ABA Model Rule DR 7-105. ABA Formal Opinion 92-363 explains that threats of prosecution are improper when the criminal charges aren't well-founded, when they're used to advance a frivolous civil claim, or when the lawyer suggests charges will be dropped in exchange for civil settlement.

I've seen discipline cases where attorneys lost their licenses over a single letter. In one case, a lawyer representing a landlord wrote to a tenant: "Pay the back rent immediately or I will report your illegal subletting to ICE and you'll be deported." The tenant was undocumented, and the lawyer thought he was being clever. Instead, he got disbarred. The State Bar found he'd violated ethics rules, committed civil extortion, and possibly criminal extortion. One letter destroyed his career.

The Neighborhood Facebook Group Nuclear Option

Sometimes the biggest legal risks come from non-lawyers who don't realize they're playing with fire. I've handled several cases where someone posted defamatory statements on social media thinking they were just "venting" or "warning people," only to face serious legal consequences.

One case involved a woman who ran a small in-home daycare. A neighbor whose child wasn't accepted (the daycare was full) posted in the HOA Facebook group: "Parents beware. [Name] runs a 'daycare' with 10+ kids crammed into one bedroom with no background checks. She leaves them unsupervised while she naps. I'm reporting her to CPS."

Everything in that post was false. The daycare provider was licensed, background-checked, limited to four children, and never left kids unsupervised. But within 24 hours, three families had withdrawn their children and two prospective clients canceled consultations. The post had been shared to two other neighborhood groups.

We sent a cease and desist letter that was very careful not to cross into extortion territory. It:

- Identified each false statement specifically
- Attached evidence proving they were false (license, inspection reports, background checks)
- Documented the concrete harm (lost clients, canceled contracts, specific dollar amounts)
- Demanded immediate removal of the posts and a retraction
- Stated that we would pursue litigation if the false statements weren't removed

What we didn't do:

- Threaten to report the poster to authorities
- Threaten to "ruin her reputation"
- Demand payment in exchange for not suing
- Copy anyone other than the poster herself

The poster removed everything within 48 hours and posted a retraction. We didn't have to file suit. But if we'd drafted that letter differently—if we'd said "remove these posts and pay $10,000 or we'll report you for harassment"—we would have created our own legal problems.

The Yelp Review That Cost Someone Six Figures

Online reviews create fascinating defamation scenarios because people assume the First Amendment protects whatever they want to say. It doesn't.

A former employee of a small bakery, fired for documented theft, posted a Yelp review claiming the owner "injects old pastries with chemicals to keep them fresh" and "uses expired cream that gave my friend food poisoning." All false. The bakery could prove it with health inspection reports, supplier invoices, and the fact that no one had ever reported food poisoning.

The review stayed up for six weeks before the owner hired a lawyer. During that time, the bakery lost a major catering contract and saw revenue drop 40%. The lawyer sent a demand letter to the ex-employee with:

- Screenshots and URLs of the specific statements
- Health department reports showing perfect compliance
- Supplier invoices showing fresh ingredients
- Documentation of the lost catering contract and revenue decline
- A demand to remove the review, post a retraction, and compensate for documented losses

The ex-employee ignored the first letter, so the bakery sued for defamation and won. The jury awarded $75,000 in damages plus attorneys' fees. An hour of spite on Yelp cost the ex-employee six figures.

The key was that the review made specific, provable false statements of fact. If the review had said "I think the pastries taste stale" or "overpriced for what you get," that would have been opinion—rude, but not actionable. But "injects old pastries with chemicals" is a factual claim that can be proven true or false.

When You Can Reference Criminal Conduct

Sometimes the conduct you're addressing genuinely may be criminal, and you need to mention that possibility without running afoul of ethics rules. Here's how to do it safely:

Focus on accurate legal analysis, not threats. You can say: "Your client's conduct appears to constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. While our client is primarily interested in civil remedies, we note that federal law enforcement has shown interest in cases involving these fact patterns."

This communicates that criminal exposure exists without threatening to make a criminal referral contingent on settlement. You're providing legal analysis, not leverage.

You can also say: "We believe these actions may constitute violations of Penal Code Section X. Our client reserves all rights to pursue any and all available remedies, both civil and criminal."

What you can't say: "Settle this for $500,000 in the next week or we're filing a police report."

Several state ethics opinions (Illinois Opinion 03-05, North Carolina ethics guidance) suggest that it's acceptable to quote or summarize applicable criminal statutes and note that the conduct could be criminal, as long as you don't condition reporting on payment.

The safest approach in California is to keep demand letters focused on civil remedies and, if criminal reporting is appropriate, do it separately and unconditionally. Don't use criminal exposure as a negotiating chip.

The Internal Checklist Before You Hit Send

Before sending any demand letter that could be considered aggressive, I run through this mental checklist:

Is every factual assertion in this letter supported by evidence I can produce if challenged? If I'm saying "your client breached the contract on March 15," I need the contract, documentation of the breach, and dates. If I'm saying "your client committed fraud," I need evidence of misrepresentation, knowledge, and damages.

Are my legal claims non-frivolous? This is the FRCP 11 standard. I don't have to be certain I'll win, but I need a good-faith basis in law and fact for everything I'm asserting.

Are all my threats limited to lawful civil remedies? Am I threatening to sue, arbitrate, or pursue administrative remedies that relate directly to the dispute? Or am I threatening to report to police, immigration, tax authorities, or to damage reputation through publicity?

Does this letter avoid conditioning silence or non-reporting on payment? If there's any suggestion of "pay us or we'll report you," I'm in dangerous territory.

Is my audience limited to parties and counsel? Am I sending this only to the person or entity I'm making claims against, or their attorney? Or am I copying their employer, customers, family, or the media?

Would I be comfortable if this letter showed up as an exhibit in a published judicial opinion? The Flatley case exists because Singer's letter was so problematic that the Supreme Court used it as an example. Your letter could be next.

If any answer makes me uncomfortable, I redraft before sending.

Practical Drafting Principles

After years of reviewing demand letters (mine and others'), here are the principles that keep you on the right side of the line:

Lead with facts, not conclusions. Instead of "Your client is a liar and a cheat," write: "On March 15, your client represented that the equipment had been inspected and certified. The inspection certificate provided was dated six months after the alleged inspection date and the certification number doesn't match any records with the certifying body."

Frame everything through the lens of anticipated litigation. "If we cannot resolve this matter informally, our client will file a complaint asserting claims for breach of contract, fraud under California Civil Code Section 1709, and unfair business practices under Business & Professions Code Section 17200."

Keep your tone professional but firm. You can be aggressive without being personal. "We believe your client's position is without merit and unsupported by the evidence" is fine. "Your client is a con artist who preys on elderly victims" is asking for problems.

Limit publication to parties and their counsel. Send your letter to the person you're making claims against, or their lawyer. Don't copy their employer, their customers, their spouse, or anyone else unless you're deliberately accepting defamation risk.

If you must reference criminal or regulatory exposure, do it factually and non-conditionally. "Your client's conduct may constitute violations of [statute], and our client reserves all rights to pursue any available remedies" is safer than "Settle or we're calling the DA."

Never use personal secrets or reputation as leverage. The moment you say "Pay us or your wife finds out about your affair" or "Settle or we tell your clients about your bankruptcy," you're into extortion territory regardless of how legitimate your underlying claim might be.

When the Other Side Crosses the Line

Sometimes you're on the receiving end of a problematic demand letter. What do you do?

First, recognize it for what it is. If opposing counsel has threatened to report your client to authorities unless you settle, or threatened to go to the media, or used personal secrets as leverage—that's potentially extortion, an ethics violation, or both.

Document everything carefully. Save the letter, save all emails, document any verbal threats. If they've violated rules, you'll need evidence.

Consider whether the threat is serious and credible. Sometimes desperate people write stupid letters but have no intention or ability to follow through. Other times, you're dealing with someone who will absolutely carry out their threats.

Report ethics violations to the state bar. If opposing counsel has threatened criminal prosecution to gain advantage in a civil matter, that's a Rule 3.10 violation in California and should be reported. State bars take these seriously.

Don't respond in kind. The fact that they've crossed a line doesn't give you license to do the same. Respond professionally, document their misconduct, and if necessary, seek protective orders or file your own action.

Consider whether their threats create criminal exposure. If a demand letter really does constitute extortion—if it says "pay X or we'll report you to ICE/the police/the IRS"—you can report it to law enforcement. Extortion is a crime, and prosecutors do sometimes charge these cases, especially when the extortionist is foolish enough to reduce everything to writing.

The Gray Areas

Not everything is black and white. Some scenarios sit in uncomfortable gray areas:

What if you genuinely believe conduct was criminal and you want to report it, but you'd also accept civil settlement? The ethics rules generally say you can pursue civil claims and you can report criminal conduct, but you can't condition one on the other. If you're going to report it, report it regardless of settlement. If you want to settle civilly, don't use criminal reporting as leverage.

What if your client insists you threaten criminal prosecution to get the other side to pay? Explain that you can't do that without violating ethics rules and potentially committing extortion yourself. If they insist, you may need to withdraw from representation. Don't let a client push you into career-ending misconduct.

What if the other side's conduct is egregious and you genuinely want them exposed publicly? You can file a lawsuit and let the public record speak for itself. What you can't do is threaten publicity campaigns in exchange for payment. Once you're in litigation, the First Amendment and litigation privilege give you broad protection for what you say in pleadings and at hearings. But pre-litigation threats of publicity for payment are dangerous.

What if you want to send a demand letter to someone who isn't your client's direct counterparty—like a guarantor or a parent company? That's usually fine as long as they're legally connected to the dispute. What's not fine is sending letters to third parties who have no legal relationship to the claim, for the purpose of embarrassing the defendant into paying.

Why This Matters More Than Ever

Social media and online review platforms have made reputation damage instant and permanent. Twenty years ago, if someone wanted to destroy your reputation, they had to work at it—letters to clients, phone calls, maybe an ad in the newspaper. Now they post once to Facebook or Twitter and it spreads everywhere within hours.

This creates both temptation and danger for lawyers. The temptation: "I can threaten to post about this online and they'll settle immediately." The danger: that's extortion, it's an ethics violation, and you'll get caught because everything is documented and traceable.

I've seen a disturbing trend of lawyers who treat social media like a weapon in discovery. "Settle or I'll tweet about this case" has become a real thing, and it's catastrophically stupid. The same rules apply online as in print. Threatening to damage someone's reputation on social media in exchange for payment is extortion. Posting defamatory statements about someone on social media creates the same liability as printing them in a newspaper, except now there's a permanent, timestamped, screenshot-able record of exactly what you said.

The surveillance and documentation aspects of modern communication actually make this easier to prove. When Martin Singer sent his Flatley letter, it was a physical document that had to be authenticated. Now, if you send a threatening email or text, it has metadata, server logs, and often automated backups. If you threaten someone on a recorded phone line, they have the recording. If you send a message through a platform, there are server records.

Everything leaves a trail, and everything can be used against you.

Your Demand Letter Template Should Not Include These Phrases

Having reviewed hundreds of problematic letters, here are phrases that should never appear in any demand letter you send:

"Pay us or we will report this to [police/DA/IRS/immigration/licensing board/media]"

"Settle immediately or your [clients/employer/spouse/family] will learn about [secret/embarrassing fact]"

"We will launch a publicity campaign / issue press releases / go to the media unless you settle"

"We're prepared to destroy your reputation / business / career if you don't pay"

"Your [license/visa/security clearance/custody/reputation] is at risk unless you settle"

Any variation of "pay for our silence" or "settle or we'll expose you"

If any of these phrases appear in your draft, stop immediately and redraft. You're about to commit extortion or violate ethics rules.

The Bottom Line

The line between aggressive advocacy and illegal threats is clear in principle but sometimes tricky in application. Here's the simplest framework I can give you:

Threatening civil litigation and describing the remedies your client will seek through that litigation: permissible and expected.

Threatening to report someone to criminal, regulatory, or immigration authorities unless they pay you: extortion and ethics violations.

Threatening to damage someone's reputation through publicity or exposure of secrets in exchange for payment: extortion and ethics violations.

Making specific false statements of fact that damage someone's reputation: defamation, not protected by privilege.

Sending your demand letter to third parties who aren't involved in the dispute: loss of privilege and potential defamation exposure.

The goal of every demand letter should be to clearly communicate your client's position, demonstrate the strength of your case, and create motivation to settle on reasonable terms. You can do all of that without crossing legal or ethical lines.

If you're not sure whether your letter crosses the line, ask yourself: "Would I be comfortable if a judge read this letter out loud in open court while considering whether to refer me for discipline or prosecution?" If the answer is no, redraft until the answer is yes.

The stakes are too high to gamble with gray areas. Your license, your reputation, and potentially your freedom depend on staying clearly on the right side of this line.

Frequently Asked Questions

Can I mention in a demand letter that my client plans to file a police report?

You can mention that your client intends to report conduct to authorities if you genuinely believe it's criminal and you're not conditioning the report on settlement. The key is to avoid making it sound like a bargaining chip. Say "Our client believes this conduct may be criminal and reserves the right to report it to appropriate authorities" rather than "Pay us within 10 days or we're calling the police." The first acknowledges potential criminal conduct; the second uses it as leverage, which is extortion.

What if everything I say in the demand letter is true? Can I still be sued for defamation?

Truth is an absolute defense to defamation, but that doesn't mean you won't get sued. If you make statements that damage someone's reputation, they might sue you even if everything you said is true, forcing you to spend time and money defending yourself and proving truth. Also, the litigation privilege usually protects demand letters from defamation claims anyway if they're properly directed to parties involved in a contemplated lawsuit. The bigger risk is making statements that you believe are true but can't prove, or making statements to third parties who aren't involved in the dispute.

Does the litigation privilege mean I can say whatever I want in a demand letter?

No. The litigation privilege protects communications made in connection with judicial proceedings or in serious contemplation of litigation, but it doesn't protect criminal conduct like extortion. As the Flatley case showed, if your letter constitutes extortion, the litigation privilege won't save you. Also, the privilege generally applies only to communications directed to parties or potential parties to the litigation, not to press releases or posts on social media.

What if my client wants me to threaten criminal prosecution to get the other side to settle?

Explain that you cannot do that without violating ethics rules and potentially committing extortion. California Rule of Professional Conduct 3.10 expressly prohibits threatening to present criminal charges to obtain an advantage in a civil dispute. If your client insists, you may need to consider withdrawing from the representation. You cannot let a client pressure you into conduct that could cost you your license or result in criminal charges against you.

Can I send a demand letter to someone's employer or customers to pressure them to settle?

Sending a demand letter to third parties who aren't involved in the dispute creates several problems. First, you lose the litigation privilege because the communication isn't directed at parties to a contemplated proceeding. Second, you create significant defamation exposure if any of your statements are false or can't be proven true. Third, depending on what you say and how you frame it, you may be creating extortion exposure by using reputation damage as leverage. Send your letter to the party you have a dispute with, or their attorney—not to uninvolved third parties.

What's the difference between opinion and defamation?

Pure opinion generally isn't actionable as defamation. If you say "I think their service is terrible" or "This restaurant is overpriced," those are opinions. But if you say "This restaurant uses expired food" or "This business commits fraud by charging for services never provided," those are factual statements that can be proven true or false. The line isn't always clear, but courts look at whether a reasonable person would understand the statement as asserting provable facts rather than subjective opinion. Context matters too—saying "this place is a dump" in a casual conversation is more likely to be understood as opinion than saying "health inspectors found rat droppings throughout this restaurant's kitchen."

If I receive an extortionate demand letter, should I just ignore it?

Don't ignore it, but don't necessarily comply with it either. Document everything carefully—save the letter, any emails, record any verbal threats. Consider whether the underlying claim might have merit even if the threats are improper. Sometimes people make bad strategic choices while pursuing legitimate claims. Consult with an attorney about your options, which might include: responding to the legitimate aspects of the claim while rejecting the improper threats, reporting ethics violations to the state bar, or in extreme cases reporting potential extortion to law enforcement. Every situation is different, but "ignore it completely" is rarely the best strategy.

Can I threaten to file a complaint with someone's licensing board (State Bar, medical board, etc.) to get them to settle a civil claim?

Generally no, at least not in California. Rule 3.10 prohibits threatening to present "criminal, administrative, or disciplinary charges" to obtain an advantage in a civil dispute. A licensing board complaint is a disciplinary charge. Now, if someone has genuinely violated professional standards and you want to report them, you can do that separately from your civil claim. But you can't say or imply "settle our civil case or we'll file a bar complaint." That's an ethics violation and potentially civil extortion.

What happens if I send a threatening letter and the recipient reports me to the state bar?

The state bar will open an investigation. You'll be asked to respond to the complaint, and you'll need to provide your side of the story and any supporting documentation. If the bar finds probable cause that you violated ethics rules, the matter can proceed to formal discipline proceedings. Depending on the severity of the violation, sanctions can range from a private reproval to suspension or disbarment. Ethics violations involving threats of criminal prosecution, extortion, or dishonesty are taken very seriously. This is one reason why it's critical to get demand letters right the first time—the consequences of getting them wrong can be career-ending.

Are emails and text messages subject to the same rules as formal demand letters?

Absolutely. The method of communication doesn't change the legal analysis. If you send a threatening email or text that constitutes extortion, you face the same legal and ethical consequences as if you'd sent a formal letter on letterhead. In fact, emails and texts can sometimes be worse because they're often more informal, leading people to be less careful about what they say. Plus, they create permanent electronic records that are easily preserved and produced as evidence. Apply the same care and professional standards to every communication, regardless of format.

What should I do if I think I already sent a problematic demand letter?

Consult immediately with an attorney who handles legal malpractice and ethics issues—not a general practitioner, someone who specifically deals with attorney discipline and ethics. Be completely candid about what you wrote and why. Depending on the circumstances, you may be able to clarify or retract the problematic portions before serious damage is done. If the recipient has already responded by threatening to file a bar complaint or criminal charges, you need experienced counsel right away. Don't try to fix this yourself, and don't send additional communications that might make things worse. Get professional help immediately.
