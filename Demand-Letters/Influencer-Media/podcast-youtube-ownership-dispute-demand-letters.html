<div class="info-box">
<strong>🎬 Co-Creator Problem:</strong> When multiple creators launch a podcast or YouTube channel together without clear ownership agreements, breakups create chaos: Who owns the channel? Who controls the accounts? How is revenue split? Who owns the back catalog? These disputes escalate quickly when one party locks out the other or keeps all the money.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Default Ownership Rules (No Agreement)</div>

<p><strong>If no written agreement exists, default rules apply:</strong></p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Asset</th>
<th>Ownership Rule</th>
<th>Why</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>YouTube channel</td>
<td>Whoever created/registered the account owns it</td>
<td>YouTube ToS: account owned by registrant; can't be "jointly owned"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Podcast RSS feed</td>
<td>Whoever registered with hosting platform owns it</td>
<td>Account ownership determines control</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Show name/trademark</td>
<td>First to use in commerce (or whoever registered trademark)</td>
<td>Trademark law: rights vest in first user or registrant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Episode content (copyright)</td>
<td>Joint authors IF both contributed copyrightable expression</td>
<td>Copyright law: joint authorship requires intent to merge contributions</td>

<div class="danger-box">
<strong>🚨 Platform Control = Power:</strong> Whoever controls the YouTube channel admin, podcast hosting account, or social media logins has de facto control - they can lock out co-creators, keep revenue, delete content. Technical access often determines outcome, regardless of "fair" ownership. Secure your access rights FIRST.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Joint Authorship vs. Individual Ownership</div>

<p><strong>Joint work (17 U.S.C. § 101):</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> "Work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole"</li>
<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> (1) Each author contributed independently copyrightable expression, (2) Authors intended joint work at time of creation, (3) Contributions merged into unitary whole</li>
<li><strong>Rights:</strong> Joint authors are co-owners with equal undivided interests; each can license/exploit work, subject to duty to account to other co-owners for profits</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Two podcast co-hosts each write and perform their own segments, intending to merge into single episode = joint work</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOT joint work (individual ownership):</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>One creator makes copyrightable content, other provides non-copyrightable input:</strong> Host writes/performs show, co-host just provides ideas or feedback = Host owns copyright (ideas not copyrightable)</li>
<li><strong>Contributions not merged:</strong> Two creators make separate videos posted to one channel = each owns their video separately</li>
<li><strong>Work-for-hire:</strong> One creator pays other as contractor to create content = paying party owns (if work-for-hire agreement signed)</li>
<li><strong>No intent to merge:</strong> Creators didn't intend joint ownership at time of creation</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Partnership vs. No Partnership</div>

<p><strong>If partnership exists (even without written agreement):</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Formation:</strong> Partnership = "association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit" (UPA § 202)</li>
<li><strong>Can be informal:</strong> No written agreement required; actions and intent determine existence</li>
<li><strong>Equal ownership default:</strong> Partners own partnership assets equally (unless agreement says otherwise)</li>
<li><strong>Profit sharing:</strong> Partners share profits equally (unless agreement specifies different split)</li>
<li><strong>Fiduciary duties:</strong> Partners owe each other loyalty, care, good faith; can't compete or self-deal</li>
<li><strong>Liability:</strong> Partners jointly liable for partnership debts/obligations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Evidence of partnership:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Sharing profits and losses</li>
<li>Joint control over business decisions</li>
<li>Holding out as partners to public/sponsors</li>
<li>Equal contribution of labor, skills, or capital</li>
<li>Using "we/our" language in show description, social media</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOT a partnership:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Employee/contractor:</strong> One creator employs other for salary/fee (no profit share, no joint control)</li>
<li><strong>Guest appearances:</strong> Host invites guests on show; guests don't share ownership</li>
<li><strong>Licensor/licensee:</strong> One creator licenses content to other's channel for fee</li>

<div class="content-section">
<div class="section-title">Common Ownership Disputes</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">1. Lockout Disputes</div>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> One co-creator locks other out of accounts after falling-out</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Alex and Jordan co-host podcast "The Daily Deep Dive." Alex registered podcast hosting account, YouTube channel, and social media in Alex's personal name. After disagreement, Alex changes passwords, locks Jordan out, continues producing show solo.</p>

<p><strong>Jordan's claims:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Partnership dissolution:</strong> We were partners; you can't unilaterally keep partnership assets</li>
<li><strong>Joint authorship:</strong> I co-created episodes; I own copyright too; you can't use episodes without my consent</li>
<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> You took joint property (revenue, access) for yourself exclusively</li>
<li><strong>Breach of fiduciary duty:</strong> As partner, you owed me loyalty; locking me out and keeping revenue is breach</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Alex's defenses:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Account ownership:</strong> I registered all accounts in my name; I own them per platform ToS</li>
<li><strong>No partnership:</strong> You were contributor/guest, not partner; no profit-sharing agreement existed</li>
<li><strong>Individual copyright:</strong> I wrote scripts and produced; your contribution was minimal/not copyrightable</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Resolution paths:</strong></p>
<ol class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Restore access + negotiate buyout:</strong> Jordan regains access; parties negotiate Jordan's exit and buyout of interest</li>
<li><strong>Immediate injunction:</strong> Jordan files for emergency court order requiring Alex to restore access and preserve revenue pending resolution</li>
<li><strong>Revenue accounting + damages:</strong> Alex keeps control but pays Jordan share of revenue earned during dispute</li>
<li><strong>Forced dissolution:</strong> Court orders show shut down or sold, proceeds split</li>
</ol>

<div class="section-subtitle">2. Revenue Withholding</div>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> One co-creator receives all platform revenue, doesn't share with other</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Taylor and Sam co-host YouTube channel. Taylor controls AdSense account; receives all ad revenue ($10k/month). Taylor claims Sam only deserves payment for "time spent" (3 hours/week × $50/hr = $600/month), not 50% profit share.</p>

<p><strong>Sam's claims:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Partnership accounting:</strong> We're partners; entitled to 50% of profits (absent agreement specifying different split)</li>
<li><strong>Breach of contract:</strong> We agreed to split revenue equally (prove via texts, emails, verbal agreement)</li>
<li><strong>Unjust enrichment:</strong> Taylor unjustly enriched by keeping revenue from jointly-created content</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Taylor's defenses:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>No agreement to split:</strong> Never agreed to 50/50; Sam was compensated guest/contractor</li>
<li><strong>Unequal contribution:</strong> I do 90% of work (editing, production, sponsorships); Sam just shows up to record</li>
<li><strong>I own channel:</strong> I created channel, built audience, control monetization; Sam contributed later</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Resolution:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>If partnership proven: Taylor must account for all revenue and pay Sam's share (likely 50/50 default)</li>
<li>If no partnership: Sam may still recover under unjust enrichment or quantum meruit (reasonable value of services)</li>
<li>Going forward: Formalize split (could be 50/50, 60/40, or other based on contributions)</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">3. Departure/Buyout Disputes</div>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> One co-creator wants out; other won't buy them out or disputes valuation</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Casey and Morgan co-created podcast. Casey wants to leave and demands buyout of $100k (50% of what Casey values show at). Morgan offers $10k. Stalemate.</p>

<p><strong>Casey's position:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Show generates $15k/month; worth $300k (20× monthly revenue industry standard); my 50% = $150k; willing to accept $100k</li>
<li>I built audience, negotiated major sponsors; deserve fair buyout</li>
<li>If you won't buy me out, sell the show and split proceeds</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Morgan's position:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>You want to leave; not my problem; find your own buyer for your share</li>
<li>Show value speculative; most of value is my personal brand, not the "show" itself</li>
<li>I'll give you $10k and full release to leave quietly; otherwise you get nothing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Resolution options:</strong></p>
<ol class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Forced buyout:</strong> Court-ordered appraisal + one party must buy other out at appraised value</li>
<li><strong>Shotgun clause (if in agreement):</strong> One party names price; other must buy or sell at that price</li>
<li><strong>Liquidation:</strong> Shut down show, sell assets (channel, back catalog, social accounts), split proceeds</li>
<li><strong>Deadlock dissolution:</strong> Court dissolves partnership, appoints receiver to liquidate assets</li>
<li><strong>Competing shows:</strong> Both parties leave, each starts new show (if no non-compete), show shuts down</li>
</ol>

<div class="section-subtitle">4. Use of Name/IP After Split</div>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> After split, one party continues using show name or IP the other claims to own</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Chris and Pat co-created "Tech Talk Daily" podcast. They split up. Chris continues producing "Tech Talk Daily" solo. Pat demands Chris stop using the name.</p>

<p><strong>Pat's claims:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Trademark infringement:</strong> I co-own "Tech Talk Daily" name; you can't use without my consent</li>
<li><strong>Unfair competition:</strong> Consumers confused into thinking your solo show is our original joint show</li>
<li><strong>Breach of partnership:</strong> Show name is partnership asset; you can't take for yourself</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Chris's defenses:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>I registered trademark:</strong> I filed trademark in my name; I own it</li>
<li><strong>I created the name:</strong> I came up with name before you joined; you contributed nothing to brand</li>
<li><strong>You abandoned interest:</strong> You left; I'm keeping show going; you can't stop me now</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Resolution:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>If joint ownership of name/trademark: Neither can use without other's consent OR court orders co-exclusive use (both can use) OR one buys out other's interest in name</li>
<li>If one party has superior trademark rights: That party can enjoin other from using name</li>
<li>Common settlement: Departing party gets paid transition period (6-12 months) while continuing party phases out their involvement; continuing party keeps name</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">5. Back Catalog / Archive Disputes</div>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> After split, dispute over who owns old episodes and can monetize them</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Drew and Riley created 200 podcast episodes together over 3 years. They split. Drew (who controls hosting account) keeps all 200 episodes live, earning $3k/month from ads. Riley demands episodes be taken down or revenue shared.</p>

<p><strong>Riley's claims:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Joint authorship:</strong> I co-created all episodes; I own copyright; you need my consent to continue distributing</li>
<li><strong>Right of publicity:</strong> My voice/likeness in episodes; you can't use commercially without my consent</li>
<li><strong>Partnership assets:</strong> Back catalog is partnership asset; you can't monetize for yourself post-dissolution</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Drew's defenses:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Joint authorship = joint rights:</strong> As joint author, I can license/exploit work without your consent (subject to accounting to you for profits)</li>
<li><strong>Implied license:</strong> We both intended episodes to be publicly distributed; you granted implied license</li>
<li><strong>Estoppel:</strong> You participated in creating and distributing episodes for years; can't object now</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Resolution:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Continue distribution, split revenue:</strong> Episodes stay live; Drew pays Riley 50% of ad revenue from old episodes</li>
<li><strong>Buyout of back catalog:</strong> Drew pays Riley lump sum for Riley's interest in old episodes; Drew keeps 100% going forward</li>
<li><strong>Take down old episodes:</strong> Remove from all platforms to avoid ongoing dispute (lose revenue but clean break)</li>
<li><strong>Archive episodes (no monetization):</strong> Episodes stay available but ads/monetization removed</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If no written agreement specifies revenue split, courts consider:</strong></p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Factor</th>
<th>Analysis</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Partnership existence</td>
<td>If partnership, default = equal split (50/50) unless proven otherwise</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contribution levels</td>
<td>Unequal contributions may justify unequal split (but burden on party claiming unequal)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prior course of dealing</td>
<td>If parties previously split revenue 60/40, that becomes implied agreement</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Communications about split</td>
<td>Texts/emails discussing "50/50" or other split = evidence of agreement</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Industry custom</td>

<p><strong>Contribution-based split arguments:</strong></p>

<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Claiming larger share:</strong> "I do 70% of work (editing, production, booking guests, social media); partner just shows up to record; I deserve 70% of revenue"</li>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> "Partnership default is equal split regardless of who does more work; if you wanted different split, should have documented it; my on-air talent is what drives audience"</li>
<li><strong>Court analysis:</strong> Difficult to prove unequal split without written agreement; equal presumption strong; but if contribution disparity extreme (e.g., 95/5), court may adjust</li>

• Monthly expenses: $2,000 (editing, hosting, promotion)
• Net monthly profit: $10,000
• Annual profit: $120,000

Valuation methods:
1. Revenue multiple: $144k annual revenue × 2 = $288,000
2. Profit multiple: $120k annual profit × 3 = $360,000
3. Average: ~$320,000

50% buyout: $160,000

YOUTUBE CHANNEL: "Tech Review Bros"
• Subscribers: 500,000
• Monthly AdSense: $15,000
• Annual revenue: $180,000
• Expenses: $30,000/year
• Net profit: $150,000/year

Valuation:
• Profit multiple: $150k × 2.5 = $375,000
• Subscriber value: 500k × $2/sub = $1,000,000 (high for engaged tech audience)
• Blended: ~$500,000-$700,000

50% buyout: $250,000-$350,000</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Buyout Negotiation Strategies</div>

<p><strong>For departing co-creator (seeking maximum buyout):</strong></p>

<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Hire appraiser:</strong> Get professional valuation to anchor negotiation high</li>
<li><strong>Emphasize your contribution:</strong> Document your role in building audience, landing sponsors, creating content</li>
<li><strong>Threaten alternatives:</strong> "If you won't buy me out, I'll compete with you (launch rival show) or force sale of entire show"</li>
<li><strong>Highlight growth trajectory:</strong> Show revenue increasing, use future projections to justify higher multiple</li>
<li><strong>Lock up leverage:</strong> If you control accounts/access, don't give up until paid</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For continuing co-creator (minimizing buyout cost):</strong></p>

<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Challenge value:</strong> "Revenue declining; sponsors leaving; audience loyalty is to ME not the show"</li>
<li><strong>Emphasize your contribution:</strong> "You're leaving because I do all the work; show won't exist without me"</li>
<li><strong>Offer earn-out:</strong> "I'll pay you percentage of revenue for next 12 months instead of lump sum (reduces risk for me)"</li>
<li><strong>Highlight risks:</strong> "Show could fail without you; I'm taking all the risk continuing; discount justified"</li>
<li><strong>Lowball + walk away alternative:</strong> "Take $X or get nothing; I'll rebrand and start over"</li>

Re: Unlawful Lockout from [Show Name] - Immediate Restoration of Access Required

Dear [Name]:

I am writing regarding your unlawful lockout of me from our jointly-owned podcast/YouTube channel "[Show Name]" and your misappropriation of partnership revenue.

PARTNERSHIP RELATIONSHIP:

In [Month, Year], you and I formed a partnership to create and operate "[Show Name]." We agreed to:
• Co-create content as equal partners
• Split all revenue 50/50
• Share decision-making equally
• Build the show together as co-owners

Evidence of partnership:
• We held ourselves out as "co-hosts" and "partners" to sponsors, audiences, and industry
• We jointly appeared on all episodes (200+ episodes over 3 years)
• We equally participated in content creation, guest booking, sponsor negotiations
• We split revenue 50/50 for first 2 years (bank records attached)
• All promotional materials listed us as "Co-Hosts" and "Co-Creators"

This is a legal partnership under [State] law, with all attendant rights and duties.

YOUR UNLAWFUL ACTIONS:

On [Date], following our disagreement about [topic], you unilaterally:

1. LOCKED ME OUT OF ALL ACCOUNTS:
• Changed YouTube channel login credentials (I can no longer access)
• Changed podcast hosting account (Megaphone) password
• Changed Instagram, Twitter, TikTok passwords
• Removed me as admin from all platforms

2. CONTINUED PRODUCING SHOW WITHOUT ME:
• Published Episode [X] on [date] - without my participation or consent
• Announced I was "taking break" (false - you locked me out)
• Continued booking guests and publishing content

3. MISAPPROPRIATED PARTNERSHIP REVENUE:
• Kept all sponsorship revenue from [Sponsor A] ($15,000 - my 50% = $7,500 owed)
• Kept all AdSense revenue (estimated $8,000/month for 2 months = $8,000 owed)
• Kept Patreon subscriber revenue ($3,000/month × 2 = $3,000 owed)
• Total revenue withheld: $18,500

4. USED JOINTLY-OWNED CONTENT WITHOUT CONSENT:
• Continued distributing 200 episodes we co-created (I own 50% copyright as joint author)
• Used show name, logo, and branding we jointly created
• Used our joint social media accounts to promote your solo episodes

LEGAL VIOLATIONS:

Your conduct violates multiple legal duties:

1. BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY:
As my partner, you owe me duties of loyalty, care, and good faith. Locking me out, taking partnership assets (accounts, revenue), and operating show for your sole benefit = egregious breach.

2. CONVERSION:
You have wrongfully exercised control over partnership property (accounts, revenue) to my exclusion. This is conversion of my property interest.

3. BREACH OF CONTRACT:
Our partnership agreement (even if informal) required 50/50 split and joint decision-making. You breached by excluding me and keeping all revenue.

4. COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT:
I am joint author of all 200 episodes (17 U.S.C. § 101 - joint work). While joint authors can each exploit work, you must account to me for profits. You have not. Also, continuing show without me may create false impression I endorse your new solo episodes (violates my publicity rights).

5. UNFAIR COMPETITION / TRADEMARK:
We jointly own "[ Show Name]" trademark rights (through use in commerce). You can't unilaterally exclude me from using it or use it to mislead audiences.

DEMAND - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED (within 48 hours):

1. RESTORE MY ACCESS:
• Provide login credentials for YouTube channel, podcast hosting, all social media accounts
• Restore me as admin/co-owner on all platforms
• If you changed passwords, send new passwords immediately

2. ACCOUNTING OF REVENUE:
• Provide complete accounting of all revenue received since [lockout date]
• Include: sponsorships, AdSense, Patreon, affiliate commissions, merchandise sales

3. PAY MY SHARE:
• Wire transfer $18,500 (my 50% of revenue) within 7 days
• Provide accounting showing calculation

4. CEASE UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY:
• Stop publishing new episodes until we resolve partnership status
• Post correction that I did not "take break" but was locked out by you

CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE:

If you do not restore access within 48 hours and pay revenue within 7 days, I will immediately:

1. FILE EMERGENCY INJUNCTION:
• Seek temporary restraining order (TRO) requiring you to restore my access
• Request court-appointed receiver to take control of accounts pending resolution
• Freeze all revenue accounts

2. FILE LAWSUIT for:
• Breach of fiduciary duty
• Breach of contract (partnership agreement)
• Conversion (taking partnership property)
• Copyright infringement (use of jointly-owned content)
• Accounting and disgorgement of all profits
• Dissolution of partnership
• Damages: Lost income, reputation harm, emotional distress
• Attorney's fees and costs

3. DMCA TAKEDOWN NOTICES:
• File copyright takedown notices with YouTube, podcast platforms for all episodes I co-created
• May result in channel strike or termination

4. PUBLIC STATEMENT:
• Publish statement to our audience explaining you locked me out unlawfully and kept revenue
• They deserve to know the truth

I don't want litigation. I want my partnership rights respected. Restore my access and pay what you owe. Then we can have civilized discussion about whether to continue partnership or negotiate buyout.

Respond within 48 hours.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

Re: Demand for Revenue Accounting and Payment - [Show Name]

Dear [Name]:

I am writing to demand accounting and payment of my share of revenue from our jointly-created YouTube channel "[Show Name]."

OUR AGREEMENT:

When we launched [Show Name] in [date], we agreed to:
• Co-create content as equal partners
• Split all revenue 50/50
• Both contribute equally to content creation, production, and promotion

This is evidenced by:
• Text message [date]: You wrote "Let's split everything 50/50 and build this together"
• Email [date]: I wrote "Sounds good - equal partners on everything"
• Our joint appearances in all [X] videos
• Joint promotion on both our social media accounts

REVENUE WITHHOLDING:

You control the YouTube AdSense account (registered in your name). All ad revenue flows to you. You have failed to pay me my 50% share:

Revenue earned (based on Social Blade estimates + sponsorship deals I know about):
• YouTube AdSense (last 12 months): ~$120,000
• Sponsorship deals:
  - [Brand A]: $25,000
  - [Brand B]: $15,000
  - [Brand C]: $30,000
• Total revenue: ~$190,000

My 50% share: $95,000

Amount paid to me: $0

UNPAID BALANCE: $95,000

YOUR EXCUSES (All Invalid):

When I asked for accounting, you claimed:

1. "I do all the editing, so I deserve more":
   - We agreed 50/50 regardless of who does what tasks
   - I contribute on-screen talent, audience engagement, sponsor outreach
   - Your editing is your contribution; my on-screen work is mine
   - Partnership default is equal split absent written agreement otherwise

2. "I built the channel before you joined":
   - I joined in [Month Year] when channel had 5,000 subscribers
   - Now we have 500,000 subscribers - I helped build 99% of audience
   - Even if you claim pre-existing ownership, I'm entitled to share of growth I contributed to

3. "You can start your own channel if you want money":
   - Doesn't excuse your obligation to pay me my share of revenue from OUR joint channel
   - I'm entitled to revenue from content WE created together

LEGAL BASIS:

1. BREACH OF CONTRACT: We agreed 50/50 split; you're keeping 100%; this is breach

2. PARTNERSHIP ACCOUNTING: We are partners in business of creating content; you must account for and share profits (UPA § 401)

3. JOINT AUTHORSHIP: I am joint author of all videos; entitled to share of exploitation revenue

4. UNJUST ENRICHMENT: You are unjustly enriched by keeping revenue from jointly-created content

DEMAND:

Within 14 days:

1. PROVIDE ACCOUNTING:
   • Complete revenue accounting for last 12 months (all sources: AdSense, sponsorships, affiliate, merchandise)
   • Show gross revenue, expenses (if any), net profit
   • Provide AdSense dashboard access or screenshots proving revenue

2. PAY MY SHARE:
   • Wire $95,000 (my estimated 50% share)
   • If your accounting shows different revenue, we'll adjust

3. GOING FORWARD:
   • Set up joint bank account for all show revenue
   • Split 50/50 monthly
   • OR I get direct access to AdSense account to verify revenue

CONSEQUENCES:

If no accounting and payment within 14 days:

• File lawsuit for breach of contract, partnership accounting, unjust enrichment
• Seek court-ordered accounting of all revenue
• Seek dissolution of partnership and split of assets
• Damages: My unpaid share + interest + attorney fees
• Public disclosure of dispute (audiences deserve to know you're withholding my earnings)

I shouldn't have to sue to get what you owe me. Pay my share and let's formalize our arrangement going forward.

Respond within 14 days.

Re: Notice of Intent to Exit Partnership - Buyout Demanded

Dear [Name]:

I am writing to notify you of my intent to exit our partnership for [Show Name] and to demand buyout of my ownership interest.

PARTNERSHIP DISSOLUTION:

Due to irreconcilable differences regarding creative direction and business operations, I am exercising my right to dissolve our partnership. Effective [30 days from date], I will cease participating in content creation for [Show Name].

MY OWNERSHIP INTEREST:

I own 50% of the partnership, including:
• 50% ownership of [Show Name] brand, trademark, and goodwill
• 50% copyright in all [X] episodes we co-created
• 50% ownership of YouTube channel, podcast feed, social media accounts (even if registered in your name - partnership assets)
• 50% ownership of email list, sponsor relationships, back catalog
• 50% of all revenue and profits

BUYOUT VALUATION:

[Show Name] valuation:

Current metrics:
• Monthly revenue: $25,000 (average last 12 months)
• Annual revenue: $300,000
• Subscribers/listeners: [X]
• Monthly downloads/views: [X]

Valuation (using 2× annual revenue multiple - conservative for profitable media business):
$300,000 annual revenue × 2 = $600,000

My 50% interest: $300,000

BUYOUT DEMAND:

I demand you buy out my 50% ownership interest for $300,000, paid as follows:

Option A - Lump Sum (discount for immediate payment):
• $250,000 paid within 30 days
• I transfer all ownership rights immediately
• Clean break

Option B - Installments:
• $300,000 paid over 24 months:
  - $75,000 at signing
  - $18,750/month for 12 months ($225,000 total)
• Secured by promissory note and security interest in show assets

Option C - Earn-Out:
• $100,000 at signing
• 25% of gross revenue for 12 months (estimated $75,000)
• 15% of gross revenue for following 12 months (estimated $45,000)
• Total estimated: $220,000-$250,000
• I retain oversight/reporting rights during earn-out period

ALTERNATIVE - I BUY YOU OUT:

If you prefer to exit instead, I will buy your 50% interest on same terms (you choose payment structure from options above).

OR - FORCED SALE:

If neither of us can/will buy out the other, we will jointly sell the entire show to third party and split proceeds 50/50.

YOUR OBLIGATIONS DURING TRANSITION:

While we negotiate buyout:
• Continue splitting revenue 50/50
• Preserve all partnership assets (don't delete content, close accounts, terminate sponsors)
• Provide full accounting of current revenue, contracts, assets
• No new major decisions without joint approval (sponsor deals over $10k, rebranding, etc.)

CONSEQUENCES OF REFUSAL:

If you refuse to negotiate buyout in good faith, I will:

1. FILE LAWSUIT for judicial dissolution of partnership and court-ordered sale/buyout

2. SEEK PARTITION of partnership assets (court will force sale or award to one party with payment to other)

3. STOP PARTICIPATING in show immediately (you can't continue using my likeness, voice, prior contributions without paying me)

4. FILE DMCA takedowns for all episodes containing my copyrighted contributions

5. COMPETE (launch competing show in same niche - I'm not bound by non-compete if we don't have written agreement)

I prefer amicable resolution. I built this show with you and want to see it continue successfully (whether you run it or I do). But I need to be bought out fairly.

Respond within 14 days with your chosen option or counter-proposal.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

<div class="section-subtitle">Securing Access Rights (Before Conflict)</div>

<p><strong>Best practices for co-creators:</strong></p>

<ol class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Multi-admin access:</strong> Both co-creators have admin/owner access to ALL accounts from day one (YouTube channel managers, podcast hosting logins, social media business accounts)</li>

<li><strong>Separate business entity:</strong> Create LLC; register all accounts under LLC email (not personal); both co-creators are LLC managers with access to LLC email</li>

<li><strong>Shared password manager:</strong> Store all passwords in shared 1Password/LastPass vault accessible to both parties</li>

<li><strong>Written agreement specifying access:</strong> "Both parties shall at all times maintain full administrative access to all Platform accounts. Neither party may remove other party's access without 30 days notice."</li>

<li><strong>Regular access audits:</strong> Monthly check that both parties still have access; if one discovers they've been removed, immediate red flag</li>

<li><strong>Platform account transfers in writing:</strong> If one party holds primary account, written agreement: "Primary account holder acknowledges they hold account in trust for partnership and will not revoke co-creator's access or transfer account without consent"</li>
</ol>

<div class="section-subtitle">Regaining Access After Lockout</div>

<p><strong>Immediate steps if locked out:</strong></p>

<ol class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Document the lockout:</strong> Screenshot attempts to log in; record exact date/time you discovered lockout; save any communications from co-creator about it</li>

<li><strong>Demand restoration (email + certified mail):</strong> "You have locked me out of [accounts]. This violates my partnership rights. Restore my access within 48 hours or I will seek emergency court relief."</li>

<li><strong>Platform support (low success but try):</strong>
   • YouTube: Report via TeamYouTube Twitter or support form; explain ownership dispute
   • Google: Submit account recovery request citing ownership dispute
   • Podcast hosts: Contact support with proof of ownership interest
   • Instagram/Facebook: Report hacked account (may work if you previously had access)
   • Most platforms won't intervene without court order</li>

<li><strong>Emergency court relief (TRO/preliminary injunction):</strong>
   • File motion for temporary restraining order requiring co-creator to restore access
   • Argue immediate irreparable harm (losing revenue, audience, can't operate business)
   • Request court order compelling disclosure of passwords
   • If granted, co-creator must comply or face contempt</li>

<li><strong>Appointment of receiver:</strong> Request court appoint neutral third party to take control of accounts pending resolution of dispute</li>

<li><strong>DMCA counter-strategy:</strong> If you're joint copyright owner, threaten DMCA takedown of all episodes you co-created unless access restored (nuclear option - may get entire channel terminated)</li>
</ol>

<div class="section-subtitle">Platform-Specific Strategies</div>

<p><strong>YouTube Channel Recovery:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>If you previously had channel manager access, YouTube may have record - cite this in support request</li>
<li>If you appear in videos, cite copyright ownership in your appearance/performance</li>
<li>If channel terminates due to dispute, both parties lose - use as negotiation leverage</li>
<li>Court order is most effective: Judge orders account holder to provide access or transfer ownership</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Podcast RSS Feed Control:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>RSS feed ownership depends on hosting platform account</li>
<li>If locked out of hosting account, can't update/control feed distribution to Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.</li>
<li>Strategy: Contact hosting provider, explain dispute, request they freeze account or require court order before changes</li>
<li>Nuclear option: Create NEW podcast feed under your control, contact Apple/Spotify to transfer subscribers (requires proving ownership - difficult)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Social Media Account Disputes:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Personal accounts (Instagram, Twitter, TikTok) nearly impossible to recover without original owner cooperation</li>
<li>Business accounts (Facebook Page, Instagram Business) may have multiple admins - harder to lock out</li>
<li>If locked out: (1) Try platform account recovery, (2) Legal demand + threaten trademark infringement claim if account uses show name you co-own, (3) Court order is best option</li>
<li>Practical reality: May need to start fresh on new account and rebuild following</li>

<div class="section-subtitle">Sample Court Filing - Emergency TRO for Access</div>

<div class="sample-letter">[Caption for Motion for Temporary Restraining Order]

MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER
REQUIRING RESTORATION OF ACCESS TO PARTNERSHIP ACCOUNTS

Plaintiff [Your Name] moves for temporary restraining order requiring Defendant [Co-Creator] to immediately restore Plaintiff's access to the following accounts operated as partnership assets:

1. YouTube channel "[Show Name]" (account: [email])
2. Podcast hosting account (Megaphone - account: [email])
3. Instagram account @[showname]
4. Google AdSense account [ID]
5. Patreon account "[Show Name]"

GROUNDS:

1. LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON MERITS:
   • Plaintiff and Defendant are partners in podcast/YouTube business
   • Plaintiff has ownership interest in all partnership assets including accounts
   • Defendant breached fiduciary duty by locking Plaintiff out
   • Plaintiff will prevail on claims for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, partnership dissolution

2. IRREPARABLE HARM:
   • Plaintiff losing $10,000+ per month in income from revenue split
   • Plaintiff's reputation damaged by inability to participate in show bearing Plaintiff's name/likeness
   • Partnership business deteriorating due to Plaintiff's inability to access accounts
   • Monetary damages inadequate - partnership opportunities lost forever
   • Harm occurring NOW and will continue daily until access restored

3. BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS:
   • Plaintiff: Losing livelihood, reputation, business interest
   • Defendant: Minimal hardship from restoring access Plaintiff is entitled to
   • Defendant can still operate accounts - just must share access with rightful co-owner

4. PUBLIC INTEREST:
   • Enforcing partnership rights and preventing one partner from misappropriating partnership assets serves public interest

REQUESTED RELIEF:

Court order requiring Defendant to immediately (within 24 hours of order):
• Provide Plaintiff with login credentials to all accounts listed above
• Restore Plaintiff as admin/manager/co-owner with full permissions
• Refrain from changing passwords, removing Plaintiff's access, or transferring accounts
• Preserve all account assets pending resolution of underlying dispute

My co-host registered the YouTube channel in their name - do I have any ownership rights?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Yes, likely. YouTube ToS says account owned by registrant, but that's between you and YouTube, not determinative of legal ownership between you and co-host. If you're partners in the business of creating content, the channel is a partnership asset regardless of who registered it. Account holder holds legal title, but you own 50% beneficial interest. Evidence to prove partnership: (1) Revenue sharing, (2) Joint decision-making, (3) Equal participation in content creation, (4) Holding out as "co-hosts" or "partners," (5) Both appearing in videos. If partnership proven, you're entitled to: (1) Access as co-owner, (2) 50% of revenue, (3) Buyout of your interest if you leave. Account holder can't keep channel for themselves just because they clicked "register." Court can order transfer of channel or impose constructive trust (account holder holds for benefit of partnership). Get evidence of partnership relationship and assert your rights before account holder claims sole ownership.

Can I force my co-creator to buy me out if they refuse?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Yes, through judicial dissolution. If you and co-creator are deadlocked (you want out, they won't buy you out or sell their share), you can petition court to dissolve partnership under state partnership law. Court will either: (1) Order buyout at judicially-determined fair value (one party must buy other out at appraised price), (2) Order sale of all assets (show sold to third party, proceeds split), or (3) Award assets to one party with payment to other. Process: File petition for dissolution citing deadlock/irreconcilable differences. Court appoints appraiser to value business. Court determines who gets to keep show (usually who can pay buyout or who's more integral to show). If neither can buy out other, court orders liquidation. Shotgun clause (if in written agreement): One party names price; other must either buy at that price or sell at that price (forces resolution). If no written agreement, judicial dissolution is remedy. Takes 6-12 months typically, but forces resolution instead of indefinite stalemate.

My co-creator locked me out of the accounts - can I start a competing show?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Probably yes, unless you have written non-compete. Without written agreement prohibiting competition, you're generally free to start competing show. Exceptions: (1) Fiduciary duty: While partnership still exists and you're trying to resolve dispute in good faith, you may have duty not to compete (consult attorney). (2) Trade secret misappropriation: Can't steal confidential business info (sponsor contacts, proprietary content strategies) to compete. (3) Trademark: Can't use show name if co-owned or other party has superior rights. (4) Copyright: Can't use jointly-created content without permission (though as joint author, you can use subject to accounting for profits to co-author). Strategic considerations: (1) Competing show may strengthen your negotiating position (if you'll succeed anyway, co-creator more motivated to buy you out), (2) May breach fiduciary duty if done while partnership active (wait until formally dissolved or get legal advice), (3) Better to negotiate exit first, then compete if needed. Best approach: Send demand for buyout or dissolution, negotiate exit, THEN start new show once you're no longer partners. Or argue partnership dissolved by co-creator's lockout (they breached, partnership terminated, you're free to compete).

How much is my podcast/YouTube channel worth for buyout purposes?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Typical valuation: 1-3× annual revenue for content businesses. Factors: (1) Revenue: Use last 12 months average monthly revenue × 12. Include all sources (ads, sponsorships, memberships, merch). (2) Growth: Growing channel worth more (use higher multiple); declining channel worth less. (3) Niche: Valuable niches (finance, tech, B2B) command higher multiples than entertainment. (4) Revenue diversification: Multiple revenue streams (ads + sponsors + products) more valuable than single source. (5) Audience loyalty: Engaged audience (high watch time, comments, shares) worth more than passive viewers. (6) Transferability: If show depends on specific host's personality, less transferable (lower value); if show is format-based, more transferable. Examples: (1) $10k/month revenue, steady state, entertainment niche = $120k annual revenue × 1.5 = $180k value. (2) $25k/month revenue, growing 20% YoY, B2B niche = $300k annual × 2.5 = $750k value. (3) $5k/month revenue, declining, host-dependent = $60k annual × 0.8 = $50k value. Get professional appraisal if dispute; otherwise negotiate based on comparable sales in your niche. Your 50% = half of total value.

Can I take down all our old episodes if my co-creator locked me out?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
As joint copyright owner, you have nuclear option: DMCA takedown. If you and co-creator jointly created episodes (both contributed copyrightable expression), you're joint authors. Joint authors each have right to exploit work, BUT must account to other joint authors for profits. Your co-creator is violating accounting duty by keeping all revenue. You can file DMCA takedown notices with YouTube, podcast platforms claiming copyright infringement. Platform must take down content unless co-creator files counter-notice claiming they have rights. Risk: (1) Co-creator can counter-notice arguing they're joint author with right to exploit (puts content back up), (2) If you file false DMCA knowing co-creator has joint rights, you may be liable for damages, (3) Takes down content both of you rely on for income - mutually assured destruction. Better strategy: Use DMCA as threat/leverage ("Restore my access and pay my revenue share, or I'll file DMCA and take down all episodes - neither of us earns money then"). Forces negotiation. Only actually file DMCA if: (1) Co-creator won't negotiate at all, (2) You're willing to blow up show to make point, (3) You have lawyer advise it's strategic move. DMCA is nuclear option - use to get to settlement table, not as first move.
