<div class="section-title">Podcast Sponsorship Nonpayment Overview</div>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>The Payment Problem:</strong> Podcast creators frequently face nonpayment from sponsors, advertising agencies, and brand partners. After delivering agreed-upon ad reads, hosts discover payments are delayed, reduced, or never arrive. Without formal contracts or with vague payment terms, creators struggle to collect what they are owed.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Common Nonpayment Scenarios</div>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Scenario</th>
<th>What Happens</th>
<th>Common Excuses</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Direct sponsor nonpayment</td>
<td>Brand contracted directly, received ads, refuses to pay</td>
<td>"Campaign didn't perform," "Budget cut," "Wrong contact"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Agency withholding payment</td>
<td>Agency placed deal, claims brand hasn't paid them</td>
<td>"Waiting on client," "Net-90 terms," "Invoice lost"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Partial payment dispute</td>
<td>Sponsor pays less than agreed, claims performance issues</td>
<td>"Downloads lower than expected," "Wrong audience"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Payment terms manipulation</td>

<td>"Policy changed to Net-120," "Finance department backlog"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Company closure/bankruptcy</td>

<td>"Company dissolved," "No assets available"</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="section-subtitle">Who Is Responsible for Payment?</div>

<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Direct deals:</strong> The brand/sponsor that signed your agreement is responsible</li>
<li><strong>Agency deals:</strong> Usually the agency is your contracting party and owes payment regardless of brand payment status</li>
<li><strong>Network deals:</strong> Your podcast network is responsible per your network agreement; network collects from sponsors</li>
<li><strong>Platform deals:</strong> If placed through Spotify, iHeart, etc., platform is responsible per creator terms</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Contract Terms Control:</strong> Your agreement determines who owes payment and when. Review carefully for: (1) Who signed as paying party, (2) Payment timeline (Net-30, Net-60, etc.), (3) Sequential liability clauses (agency only pays if brand pays), (4) Performance-based payment reductions.

<div class="section-title">Common Payment Disputes & Responses</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Dispute 1: "Campaign Didn't Perform"</div>

<p><strong>Sponsor claims:</strong> "Downloads/conversions were lower than expected, so we're reducing payment."</p>

<p><strong>Your response:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Review contract for performance guarantees - did you guarantee specific numbers?</li>
<li>If no guarantee: Payment is due regardless of campaign performance unless contract says otherwise</li>
<li>If CPM-based: Payment should match actual downloads delivered, verified by hosting platform</li>
<li>If flat fee: Full payment due upon delivery of ads as specified</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Sample response:</strong> "Our agreement specified a flat fee of $5,000 for three ad reads across episodes 100-102. The contract contains no performance guarantees or adjustment provisions. I delivered the contracted ads on the agreed dates. Full payment is due per Section 3 of our agreement."
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Dispute 2: "Waiting on Client Payment"</div>

<p><strong>Agency claims:</strong> "We haven't received payment from the brand yet, so we can't pay you."</p>

<p><strong>Your response:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Check if your contract is with agency or brand - agency likely owes you regardless</li>
<li>Look for "sequential liability" or "pay when paid" clauses (often unenforceable)</li>
<li>Agency assumed payment risk when they contracted with you</li>
<li>Agency's collection issues with their client are not your problem</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Sample response:</strong> "My contract is with [Agency Name], not the brand. Your agreement with your client is separate from our agreement. Per our contract dated [date], payment of $X was due on [date]. The agency is obligated to pay regardless of whether you have collected from your client."
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Dispute 3: "Invoice Not Received/Lost"</div>

<p><strong>Sponsor claims:</strong> "We never received an invoice," or "Invoice went to wrong department."</p>

<p><strong>Your response:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Provide proof of invoice delivery (email timestamp, read receipt)</li>
<li>Resubmit invoice immediately to correct contact</li>
<li>Request payment within 10 days of resubmitted invoice</li>
<li>Include late payment interest if contract allows</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Dispute 4: "Ads Were Not Delivered Correctly"</div>

<p><strong>Sponsor claims:</strong> "The ad reads were wrong," or "Ads not placed in agreed episodes."</p>

<p><strong>Your response:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Provide hosting platform data showing ad delivery timestamps</li>
<li>If host-read ads: Provide audio clips or transcripts of actual reads</li>
<li>If minor deviations: Argue substantial performance - payment due with minor adjustment if any</li>
<li>If sponsor never complained until payment due: Waiver/estoppel argument</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Dispute 5: "Payment Terms Changed"</div>

<p><strong>Sponsor claims:</strong> "Our policy is now Net-120" (after agreeing to Net-30).</p>

<p><strong>Your response:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Contract terms cannot be unilaterally changed after signing</li>
<li>Original payment terms apply regardless of internal policy changes</li>
<li>Demand payment per original agreement</li>
<li>Future deals can negotiate new terms; current deal bound by existing contract</li>
</ul>

<div class="danger-box">
<strong>Red Flag Sponsors:</strong> Watch for sponsors who: (1) Push for Net-90+ terms, (2) Refuse to sign written agreements, (3) Have history of nonpayment (check creator forums), (4) Are startups with uncertain funding, (5) Request ads before contract signed.

Re: Demand for Payment - [Podcast Name] Sponsorship
    Invoice Number: [#]
    Invoice Amount: $[Amount]
    Due Date: [Original Due Date]
    Days Past Due: [X]

Dear [Contact Name]:

I am writing to demand immediate payment of $[Amount] for podcast sponsorship services delivered under our agreement dated [Date].

AGREEMENT AND DELIVERY:

On [Date], [Sponsor Company] agreed to sponsor [X] episodes of [Podcast Name] for a flat fee of $[Amount]. Per our agreement:

- Episode [#] published [Date] - 60-second mid-roll ad read
- Episode [#] published [Date] - 60-second mid-roll ad read
- Episode [#] published [Date] - 60-second mid-roll ad read

All ads were delivered as specified, with copy approved by [Sponsor Contact] via email on [Date]. Combined downloads for sponsored episodes total [X], exceeding the estimated [Y] downloads discussed during negotiations.

PAYMENT STATUS:

Invoice #[X] for $[Amount] was issued on [Date] with Net-30 payment terms. Payment was due on [Date]. As of today, the invoice is [X] days past due and no payment has been received.

My follow-up emails on [dates] have not received substantive response.

DEMAND:

Pursuant to our agreement, I demand payment of the following within ten (10) days:

- Original invoice amount: $[Amount]
- Late payment interest (1.5%/month per contract): $[Amount]
- Total due: $[Amount]

CONSEQUENCES OF NON-PAYMENT:

If payment is not received within 10 days, I will:

1. Report [Sponsor Company] to podcast creator communities and sponsorship databases as a non-paying sponsor
2. File a complaint with the Better Business Bureau
3. Pursue legal action including small claims court or civil litigation
4. Seek recovery of attorney fees and collection costs as permitted by our agreement

I delivered the services as agreed. Payment is now overdue. Please remit payment immediately.

Sincerely,

Re: Demand for Payment - Podcast Campaign for [Brand Name]
    Campaign Period: [Dates]
    Contracted Amount: $[Amount]
    Amount Unpaid: $[Amount]

Dear [Contact Name]:

I am writing regarding [Agency Name]'s failure to pay $[Amount] owed for podcast advertising services.

THE AGREEMENT:

On [Date], I entered into an Insertion Order with [Agency Name] (not directly with [Brand Name]) for a podcast advertising campaign. Key terms:

- Sponsor: [Brand Name] (placed through [Agency Name])
- Episodes: [X] episodes with mid-roll ad placements
- Fee: $[Amount] flat rate
- Payment terms: Net-60 from campaign completion

THE DELIVERY:

I delivered all contracted ad placements on schedule:
[List episodes, dates, and confirmation of ad delivery]

Campaign completed on [Date]. Invoice submitted [Date]. Payment was due [Date].

YOUR EXCUSES:

When I followed up on [Date], your team stated: "[Quote excuse - e.g., 'We're waiting on payment from the brand']"

This excuse is invalid. My contract is with [Agency Name], not [Brand Name]. Your agreement with your client is a separate matter. [Agency Name] assumed the payment risk when you contracted with me. Whether [Brand Name] has paid you is irrelevant to your obligation to pay me.

[If sequential liability clause exists:]
Your Insertion Order includes a "pay when paid" provision at Section [X]. This provision is unenforceable under [State] law as against public policy. [Agency Name] cannot shift collection risk to creators who have no relationship with or leverage over your clients.

DEMAND:

I demand payment of $[Amount] within ten (10) days.

CONSEQUENCES:

If not paid within 10 days:
- I will pursue legal action against [Agency Name] for breach of contract
- I will report [Agency Name] to industry groups and creator networks
- I will seek attorney fees and collection costs in addition to the amount owed
- I will consider filing complaints with relevant advertising industry associations

[Agency Name] contracted for my services. I delivered. You owe payment regardless of your client's payment status.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

Re: Demand for Remaining Balance - [Podcast Name] Sponsorship
    Original Invoice: $[Full Amount]
    Amount Paid: $[Partial Amount]
    Balance Due: $[Remaining Amount]

Dear [Contact Name]:

I am writing regarding [Sponsor Company]'s partial payment for our podcast sponsorship campaign and your improper withholding of $[Remaining Amount].

AGREEMENT AND PERFORMANCE:

Our agreement dated [Date] specified:
- [X] ad placements across [X] episodes
- Flat fee: $[Full Amount]
- No performance guarantees or adjustment provisions

I delivered all [X] ad placements as contracted. There were no complaints about ad quality, placement, or delivery at any time before or during the campaign.

YOUR IMPROPER DEDUCTION:

On [Date], you paid $[Partial Amount] with a memo stating "[Quote reason for deduction - e.g., 'Adjusted for download shortfall']."

This deduction is improper because:

1. Our contract specified a FLAT FEE, not CPM-based pricing
2. Our contract contains NO performance guarantees or adjustment clauses
3. You never raised download concerns during the campaign
4. Actual downloads of [X] exceeded industry benchmarks for shows of our size

You cannot unilaterally reduce payment after I have fully performed my contractual obligations.

DEMAND:

Pay the remaining balance of $[Remaining Amount] within seven (7) days.

If you believe you have a legitimate contractual basis for the deduction, provide the specific contract provision authorizing it within 3 days. If no valid basis exists, remit payment immediately.

Failure to pay will result in legal action for breach of contract, including recovery of the balance due plus interest, attorney fees, and costs.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

<li>Sponsor is in your state or has office in your state</li>
<li>No arbitration clause in contract, or amount is below arbitration minimum</li>
<li>Clear documentation of agreement and delivery</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Small claims process:</strong></p>
<ol class="styled-list">
<li>File claim with local small claims court (typically $30-$100 filing fee)</li>
<li>Serve defendant (sponsor) with court papers</li>
<li>Attend hearing (usually within 30-60 days)</li>
<li>Present evidence: contract, invoice, delivery proof, communications</li>
<li>If you win: Judgment entered; collect via wage garnishment or bank levy if needed</li>
</ol>

<div class="section-subtitle">Collection Agencies</div>

<p><strong>When to use:</strong> After demand letters fail and you want to pursue collection without litigation.</p>

<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Collection agencies take 25-50% of recovered amounts</li>
<li>They report to credit bureaus, which motivates business debtors</li>
<li>Most effective for amounts over $1,000</li>
<li>Less effective for out-of-state or international sponsors</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Industry Reporting</div>

<p><strong>Non-paying sponsor databases and communities:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Podcast creator Slack groups and Discord servers</li>
<li>Reddit communities (r/podcasting, r/podcasters)</li>
<li>Industry newsletters and forums</li>
<li>Social media callouts (use carefully - avoid defamation)</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Defamation Warning:</strong> When publicly reporting non-paying sponsors, stick to verifiable facts: "Company X owes me $5,000 for ads delivered in October and has not responded to invoices." Avoid opinions or exaggerations. Truth is a defense to defamation, so document everything.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Leverage Points</div>

<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Remove ads:</strong> If unpaid, remove sponsor ads from episodes (reduces their value received)</li>
<li><strong>Negative publicity:</strong> Sponsors care about reputation; threatened exposure motivates payment</li>
<li><strong>Future business:</strong> Agency needs creator goodwill; burning bridges has consequences</li>
<li><strong>Legal costs:</strong> Defending lawsuit costs more than paying invoice</li>
</ul>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
How long should I wait before sending a demand letter?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Send friendly reminders at 7 and 14 days past due. If no response or payment by 30 days past due, send a formal demand letter. Do not wait too long, as some states have short statutes of limitations on contract claims, and sponsors may become harder to locate or collect from over time.
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What if my sponsorship deal was only verbal with no written contract?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Verbal contracts are enforceable, but harder to prove. Gather all evidence of the agreement: emails discussing terms, text messages, rate cards you sent, and evidence of delivery. The sponsor's use of your ads after you delivered them is evidence they accepted the deal. Document everything in your demand letter to establish the terms.
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Can I sue a sponsor who is in a different state?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
You may be able to sue in your state if the sponsor conducted business there (contracted with you there). Small claims court is typically limited to local defendants. For out-of-state sponsors, check if they have an office or registered agent in your state. For larger claims, you may need to sue in the sponsor's home state or use the jurisdiction clause in your contract if one exists.
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What if the sponsor's contract has an arbitration clause?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Arbitration clauses may be enforceable, but check for: (1) Minimum claim amounts - many arbitration clauses exempt small claims, (2) Unconscionability - one-sided terms may be unenforceable, (3) Cost allocation - if you'd have to pay high arbitration fees, courts may not enforce, (4) Whether you actually agreed to it (did you sign or just receive it?). An attorney can evaluate enforceability.

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Should I remove the sponsor's ads if they don't pay?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Generally yes, if they materially breached by non-payment. Send notice first: "If payment is not received by [date], ads will be removed from episodes." Removing ads is leverage - it reduces the value the sponsor received and may motivate payment. However, review your contract for any terms about ad removal that might affect your rights.

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Can I charge interest on late payments?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Only if your contract includes a late payment interest provision. Common terms are 1-1.5% per month on overdue balances. If your contract is silent on interest, you may only be entitled to the principal amount. For future deals, always include a late payment interest clause to incentivize timely payment.
