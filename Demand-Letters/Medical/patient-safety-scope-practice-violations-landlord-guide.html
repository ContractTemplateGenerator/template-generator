<h2>Patient Safety Risks for California Landlords</h2>

<p>Landlords and medical facility operators who lease space to med-spas, IV therapy clinics, aesthetic injectors, or other healthcare providers face unique patient safety and liability exposures. When tenants operate outside their scope of practice—RNs performing procedures that require physician oversight, NPs exceeding their standardized procedures, or unlicensed persons posing as medical professionals—patients are at risk and landlords face premises liability.</p>

<p>California law imposes a duty on property owners to maintain safe premises and, in some circumstances, to prevent third parties (tenants) from causing foreseeable harm to others (patients). Understanding scope-of-practice rules, recognizing red flags, and knowing when to intervene are critical to protecting your facility and avoiding liability.</p>

<h3>Why Patient Safety Matters for Landlords</h3>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Landlord Liability for Tenant Malpractice:</strong>
<ul style="margin:10px 0 0 20px">
<li><strong>Premises liability (Civ. Code § 1714):</strong> Landlords owe a duty of reasonable care to persons injured on their property. If you have <em>actual knowledge</em> of a tenant's unsafe practices and fail to act, you may be liable for patient injuries.</li>
<li><strong>Negligent selection/retention:</strong> If you knew or should have known tenant was unqualified, unlicensed, or dangerous, you may be liable for negligently renting to them or failing to evict after discovering violations.</li>
<li><strong>Vicarious liability (limited):</strong> Generally landlords are not vicariously liable for tenant malpractice unless landlord exercises control over tenant's clinical operations (which triggers CPOM issues).</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory exposure:</strong> Medical Board investigations of tenant violations often expand to include landlord—especially if Board suspects landlord facilitated or profited from unlicensed practice.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Common Patient Safety Issues in Medical Co-Working</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Safety Issue</th>
<th>Landlord Liability Risk</th>
<th>Prevention Strategy</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>RN performing procedures beyond scope</strong></td>
<td>High—if landlord knew RN lacked physician supervision and did nothing, liable for patient injuries</td>
<td>Require proof of physician supervision agreements; inspect for compliance; terminate if violations found</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Unsanitary conditions / infection risk</strong></td>
<td>Moderate—landlord liable if failure to maintain premises (e.g., mold, vermin, unsanitary common areas) contributes to infections</td>
<td>Regular facility inspections; require tenant to maintain infection control; OSHA compliance audits</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Lack of emergency equipment / protocols</strong></td>
<td>Low—generally tenant's responsibility, but landlord may be liable if emergency access blocked or facility lacks required exits</td>
<td>Verify tenant has AED, oxygen, emergency medications; ensure clear egress paths; test fire alarms</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Controlled substance diversion</strong></td>
<td>Moderate—DEA may investigate facility; landlord liable if aware of illegal drug activity and did not report or evict</td>
<td>Require tenants with DEA licenses to provide copies; report suspicious activity (e.g., high volume of opioid prescriptions)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Unlicensed practitioners</strong></td>
<td>High—landlord may face "aiding and abetting" claims if knew tenant was unlicensed and continued to rent space</td>
<td>Verify all tenant licenses via state boards; surprise inspections to confirm personnel match licensed individuals</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>The "Knowledge" Standard for Landlord Liability</h3>

<p>Landlords are generally not liable for tenant malpractice unless they have <strong>actual knowledge</strong> of unsafe conditions and <strong>fail to act reasonably</strong> to prevent harm. Key concepts:</p>

<p><strong>Actual Knowledge:</strong> You must have real awareness of the problem—not just constructive knowledge ("should have known"). Sources of actual knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct observation during inspections</li>
<li>Written notice from regulatory agencies (Medical Board, OSHA)</li>
<li>Complaints from patients, employees, or other tenants</li>
<li>Admission by tenant (e.g., "We don't have a supervising physician right now")</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reasonable Action:</strong> Once you have knowledge, you must take reasonable steps to prevent harm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demand tenant cure violations immediately</li>
<li>Prohibit tenant from operating until compliance achieved</li>
<li>Evict tenant if violations not cured</li>
<li>In extreme cases (imminent patient harm), notify regulators or emergency services</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>⚠ Don't "Willfully Blind" Yourself:</strong> Some landlords avoid inspections or ignore red flags, believing "if I don't know, I can't be liable." California courts reject willful blindness. If circumstances suggest tenant violations (e.g., tenant refuses to provide supervision documents, you observe unlicensed staff, patients complain), you have a duty to investigate. Failure to investigate when red flags exist can be deemed "actual knowledge."

</ul>

<p><strong>Supervision Requirement:</strong> NPs must practice under <strong>standardized procedures</strong> developed in collaboration with a physician. Standardized procedures must specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patient populations NP may treat</li>
<li>Conditions and procedures authorized</li>
<li>Consultation and referral requirements</li>
<li>Chart review and quality assurance protocols</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</div>

</div>

<div id="violations" class="tab-content">
<h2>Recognizing Red Flags & Scope-of-Practice Violations</h2>

<h3>Red Flag #1: No Physician On-Site or Rarely Visits</h3>

<p><strong>Observation:</strong> You've leased space to a med-spa that advertises Botox, fillers, and laser services. Over 6 months, you've never seen a physician enter the suite. RN staff arrive daily and perform treatments.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Issue:</strong> For RNs to perform medical procedures, California requires physician <em>supervision</em>, which typically means the physician must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Available for consultation (phone or in-person)</li>
<li>Conducting periodic on-site visits to observe procedures and review charts</li>
<li>Providing training and competency verification</li>
</ul>

<p>If the physician never visits, "supervision" is likely a sham. The RN is effectively practicing medicine without a license.</p>

<p><strong>Your Action:</strong> Request copies of the supervising physician's visit logs, chart review documentation, and standardized procedures. If tenant cannot produce these, demand they cease operations until compliant.</p>

<h3>Red Flag #2: High Volume of Patients with No Physician</h3>

<p><strong>Observation:</strong> Your tenant's IV therapy lounge has 10-15 patients daily, all receiving IV infusions. You've observed only one RN on-site, with no physician ever present.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Issue:</strong> High patient volume with minimal physician oversight suggests inadequate supervision. Standardized procedures for IV therapy typically require physician availability during treatment hours and chart review of a percentage of patients (e.g., 10% monthly).</p>

<p>If RN is treating 300 patients/month with physician reviewing 0% of charts, supervision is non-existent.</p>

<p><strong>Your Action:</strong> Demand proof of physician chart review (e.g., signed chart review logs showing dates and number of charts reviewed). If tenant cannot provide, this is a material lease breach.</p>

<h3>Red Flag #3: Emergency Equipment Missing or Expired</h3>

<p><strong>Observation:</strong> During a walk-through, you notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>No AED (automated external defibrillator) visible</li>
<li>No emergency medications (epinephrine, antihistamines) in treatment rooms</li>
<li>No oxygen tank or ambu bag</li>
<li>Fire extinguishers expired or missing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Legal Issue:</strong> Facilities performing aesthetic injections (Botox, fillers) must have emergency equipment for allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, and cardiovascular events. OSHA and standardized procedures typically require:</p>
<ul>
<li>AED (8 CCR § 6101.8 in some settings)</li>
<li>Emergency medications (epinephrine auto-injectors, antihistamines)</li>
<li>Oxygen and delivery system</li>
<li>Emergency protocols posted</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Your Action:</strong> This is a life-threatening deficiency. Demand immediate correction (within 48 hours) or prohibit patient treatments until equipment is in place.</p>

<h3>Red Flag #4: Unlicensed Staff Performing Medical Procedures</h3>

<p><strong>Observation:</strong> Tenant's website lists "Jane Doe, Lead Injector" with no credentials (RN, NP, PA, MD). You Google Jane Doe and find she's an esthetician, not a nurse or physician.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Issue:</strong> Estheticians cannot perform injections (Botox, fillers) or operate medical lasers. This is unlicensed practice of medicine (B&P § 2052) and is a crime.</p>

<p><strong>Your Action:</strong> Verify licenses of all clinical staff via state board websites (Medical Board, Board of Registered Nursing, Physician Assistant Board, Board of Barbering and Cosmetology). If tenant employs unlicensed persons to perform medical procedures, this is grounds for immediate lease termination and potentially a duty to report to Medical Board.</p>

<h3>Red Flag #5: Controlled Substances Without DEA License</h3>

<p><strong>Observation:</strong> Tenant advertises "weight loss clinic" with prescriptions for phentermine (Schedule IV controlled substance). Tenant's NP does not have a DEA registration.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Issue:</strong> Prescribing controlled substances requires a valid DEA registration (federal) in addition to state prescribing authority. Prescribing without DEA registration is a federal crime (21 U.S.C. § 841) and exposes your facility to DEA investigation and asset forfeiture.</p>

<p><strong>Your Action:</strong> Verify tenant's DEA registration at www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov (limited public search). If no DEA registration, prohibit controlled substance prescribing and consider reporting to DEA.</p>

<h3>Red Flag #6: "Wholesale" Medical Services to Other Tenants</h3>

<p><strong>Observation:</strong> One tenant (licensed physician) appears to be providing "medical director services" to multiple other tenants (estheticians, wellness coaches) in your co-working space. The physician charges a flat monthly fee and signs charts but never actually supervises procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Issue:</strong> This is likely <strong>Corporate Practice of Medicine (CPOM)</strong> violation and/or <strong>aiding and abetting unlicensed practice</strong> (B&P § 2053). It also exposes you (landlord) to claims that you're facilitating CPOM by providing the space for this arrangement.</p>

<p><strong>Your Action:</strong> Prohibit "medical director for hire" arrangements where physician does not actually supervise. Require each medical tenant to have their own bona fide supervision agreement with documented oversight.</p>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>⚠ When to Act Immediately:</strong> Some violations require immediate intervention to prevent patient harm:
<ul style="margin:10px 0 0 20px">
<li><strong>No emergency equipment:</strong> Patient could die from anaphylaxis if no epinephrine available—demand correction within 24 hours</li>
<li><strong>Bloodborne pathogen exposure:</strong> Overfilled sharps, blood in trash—immediate OSHA risk; prohibit operations until corrected</li>
<li><strong>Unlicensed surgery:</strong> If tenant performing surgical procedures without proper licensure, shut down immediately and call Medical Board</li>
<li><strong>Controlled substance diversion:</strong> If you suspect illegal drug sales, report to DEA and local police immediately</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Reporting Obligations for Landlords</h2>

<h3>Do Landlords Have a Duty to Report?</h3>

<p>California law generally does <strong>not</strong> require landlords to report tenant scope-of-practice violations to regulatory agencies. However, several doctrines create quasi-duties:</p>

<p><strong>1. Premises Liability Duty to Prevent Harm:</strong> If you have actual knowledge of tenant's dangerous practices and foresee patient harm, you have a <strong>tort duty</strong> to take reasonable steps to prevent harm (Civ. Code § 1714). This may include reporting to regulators if eviction alone is insufficient to stop ongoing harm (e.g., tenant continues operating during unlawful detainer proceedings).</p>

<p><strong>2. "Aiding and Abetting" Exposure:</strong> If you knowingly provide space for unlicensed medical practice and take no action, you could face claims of aiding and abetting (B&P § 2053). Reporting to authorities may be necessary to avoid criminal liability.</p>

<p><strong>3. OSHA Violations:</strong> Cal-OSHA requires employers to report serious injuries and fatalities. If you're aware of OSHA violations (bloodborne pathogen risks) and an employee or patient is injured, your failure to report or correct could trigger OSHA penalties against you as facility owner.</p>

<p><strong>4. Controlled Substance Diversion:</strong> Federal law imposes reporting duties on persons with knowledge of controlled substance diversion or illegal drug activity. Failure to report can result in DEA investigation and potential accessory-after-the-fact charges.</p>

<h3>When You Should Report (Risk-Based Analysis)</h3>

<th>To Whom?</th>
<th>Why?</th>

<h3>How to Report (Framing to Avoid Extortion Claims)</h3>

<p>When reporting tenant violations to regulators, frame your report carefully to avoid extortion or interference claims:</p>

<div class="success-box">
<strong>✓ Safe Reporting Language:</strong>
<ul style="margin:10px 0 0 20px">
<li>"We are the landlord for [Tenant Name] and have observed possible scope-of-practice violations. We are reporting out of concern for patient safety and to fulfill our legal obligations as facility operators."</li>
<li>"We demanded tenant correct violations. Tenant refused. We are reporting to prevent ongoing patient harm."</li>
<li>"We have terminated the lease due to unlicensed practice. We are notifying the Board to ensure tenant does not continue operating at another location."</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>⚠ Avoid Linking Reporting to Lease Disputes:</strong>
<ul style="margin:10px 0 0 20px">
<li>Do NOT say: "We're reporting because tenant owes us rent"</li>
<li>Do NOT say: "If tenant pays the settlement, we won't report"</li>
<li>Do NOT file reports <em>before</em> giving tenant opportunity to cure (unless imminent patient harm)</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top:10px">Reports must be motivated by patient safety, not financial disputes. Tenant can argue your report was retaliatory or extortionate if it appears tied to lease negotiations.</p>
</div>

[Suite Address]</p>
<p><strong>From:</strong> [Landlord Name / Property Management]<br>
[Address]</p>
<p><strong>RE: NOTICE OF PATIENT SAFETY VIOLATIONS – DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION</strong></p>

<p>Dear [Tenant]:</p>

<p>This letter documents serious patient-safety concerns regarding your operations and demands immediate corrective action to bring your practice into compliance with California law.</p>

<p><strong>Observations During Facility Inspection ([Date]):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>No physician on-site:</strong> Your business advertises Botox, dermal fillers, and laser treatments. During our inspection and multiple prior visits over the past 3 months, we have never observed a physician on-site.</li>
<li><strong>RN performing procedures independently:</strong> We observed RN staff administering injections to patients with no physician consultation or oversight visible.</li>
<li><strong>No emergency equipment:</strong> Treatment rooms lacked AED, epinephrine auto-injectors, oxygen, or other emergency medications required for managing allergic reactions or cardiovascular events.</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate standardized procedures:</strong> When we requested copies of your RN standardized procedures (as required by Lease Section [X]), you provided a one-page form that does not meet California Code of Regulations Title 16, § 1379 requirements.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Legal Violations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business & Professions Code § 2052 (Unlicensed Practice):</strong> RNs performing medical procedures (Botox, fillers, lasers) without adequate physician supervision constitutes unlicensed practice of medicine.</li>
<li><strong>CCR Title 16, § 1379 (Standardized Procedures):</strong> RNs may perform medical functions only under comprehensive written standardized procedures that include physician supervision, training, competency verification, and emergency protocols. Your one-page form is non-compliant.</li>
<li><strong>Patient Safety:</strong> Lack of emergency equipment creates imminent risk of patient death if anaphylaxis or adverse reaction occurs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Landlord Liability Exposure:</strong> Your violations expose our facility to premises liability under Civil Code § 1714. If patients are injured due to inadequate supervision or lack of emergency equipment, we may be held liable for knowingly permitting unsafe medical practice on our premises.</p>

<p><strong>IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS REQUIRED (within 72 hours):</strong></p>
<ol>

<h4>Sample 2: Unlicensed Practitioner (Esthetician Performing Medical Procedures)</h4>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> [Current Date]</p>
<p><strong>To:</strong> [Tenant Business Name]<br>
[Suite Address]</p>
<p><strong>From:</strong> [Landlord]<br>
[Address]</p>
<p><strong>RE: NOTICE OF UNLICENSED MEDICAL PRACTICE – IMMEDIATE CESSATION REQUIRED</strong></p>

<p>Dear [Tenant]:</p>

<p>We have discovered that your business is engaging in unlicensed practice of medicine in violation of California law. You must immediately cease all medical procedures or face lease termination and regulatory reporting.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery of Unlicensed Practice:</strong> Your business website and marketing materials advertise "Jane Doe, Lead Injector" performing Botox and dermal filler treatments. We verified Jane Doe's credentials via the Board of Barbering and Cosmetology website and confirmed she holds an <strong>esthetician license only</strong>—she is not a registered nurse, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or physician.</p>

<p>California law (Business & Professions Code §§ 7316-7320) strictly prohibits estheticians from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing injections of any kind, including Botox and dermal fillers</li>
<li>Operating medical lasers</li>
<li>Performing any procedure that penetrates below the epidermis</li>
</ul>

<p>Ms. Doe's performance of Botox injections constitutes <strong>unlicensed practice of medicine</strong> under B&P § 2052, which is a <strong>crime</strong> punishable by imprisonment and fines.</p>

<p><strong>Landlord Liability:</strong> By leasing space for unlicensed medical practice, we face:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premises liability for patient injuries caused by unlicensed practitioner</li>
<li>Potential "aiding and abetting" liability under B&P § 2053 if we continue to provide space after discovering the violation</li>
<li>Medical Board investigation and subpoenas</li>
<li>Property value diminution due to association with illegal activity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IMMEDIATE DEMANDS:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cease all injections and medical procedures immediately.</strong> Ms. Doe and any other unlicensed staff must not perform Botox, fillers, lasers, or any medical treatments.</li>
<li><strong>Provide proof of licensure</strong> for all clinical staff within 24 hours. We require copies of current RN, NP, PA, or MD licenses from the appropriate California licensing boards.</li>
<li><strong>Remove false advertising</strong> from website, social media, and marketing materials representing that unlicensed persons perform medical procedures.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If You Do Not Comply Within 24 Hours:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will serve a Three-Day Notice to Quit (no opportunity to cure—unlicensed practice is a criminal violation that cannot be cured short of ceasing operations)</li>
<li>We will file a complaint with the Medical Board of California reporting unlicensed practice at our facility</li>
<li>We will notify the District Attorney's office of suspected criminal violations (B&P § 2052)</li>
<li>We will change locks and prohibit access to premises pursuant to our right to abate criminal nuisances</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a non-negotiable patient-safety and legal compliance issue. Unlicensed practice of medicine exposes patients to serious harm and exposes us to catastrophic liability. We will not tolerate it.</p>

<p>Confirm cessation of medical procedures in writing within 24 hours to the address above.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>[Your Name]<br>
[Title]</p>

<h2>Attorney Services for Patient Safety & Scope-of-Practice Disputes</h2>

<p>Patient safety and scope-of-practice violations require urgent legal action to protect landlords from premises liability, regulatory enforcement, and criminal exposure. These disputes involve complex healthcare licensing law, tort duty analysis, and regulatory reporting strategy—areas where general landlord-tenant attorneys lack expertise.</p>

<h3>How I Can Help</h3>

<p>I represent California landlords, medical facility owners, and property managers in patient-safety disputes involving med-spa tenants, IV therapy clinics, and aesthetic providers. My practice focuses on rapid intervention, regulatory coordination, and premises liability defense.</p>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Services for Landlords & Facility Operators:</strong>
<ul style="margin:10px 0 0 20px">
<li><strong>Patient safety audits:</strong> I inspect tenant operations, review standardized procedures, verify licenses, and identify scope-of-practice violations and OSHA risks</li>
<li><strong>Demand letter strategy:</strong> I draft demands that document violations, protect you from "aiding" liability, and establish a record for premises liability defense—without creating extortion exposure</li>
<li><strong>Emergency injunctions:</strong> I obtain court orders halting unlicensed practice when tenant refuses to cease operations</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory reporting guidance:</strong> I advise on when and how to report to Medical Board, OSHA, DEA, or law enforcement—and draft reports that protect your interests</li>
<li><strong>Unlawful detainer (eviction):</strong> I prosecute evictions for scope violations, unlicensed practice, and patient safety breaches</li>
<li><strong>Premises liability defense:</strong> I defend landlords in patient injury lawsuits, proving tenant's independent contractor status and landlord's reasonable conduct</li>
<li><strong>Insurance coordination:</strong> I work with your GL carrier to ensure tenant's malpractice insurer provides defense and indemnity for patient claims</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Why Specialized Counsel Matters</h3>

<p>Patient safety disputes are time-sensitive and require healthcare regulatory expertise:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Duty analysis:</strong> Determining whether you have actual knowledge triggering a duty to act</li>
<li><strong>Scope-of-practice rules:</strong> Understanding RN/NP/PA scope, supervision requirements, and standardized procedure compliance</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory leverage:</strong> Knowing when to threaten reporting (lawful) vs. when it becomes extortion (unlawful)</li>
<li><strong>Emergency procedures:</strong> Acting within hours when patient harm is imminent—obtaining TROs, coordinating with emergency services, shutting down operations</li>
<li><strong>Premises liability defense strategy:</strong> Building a record that demonstrates you took reasonable action upon learning of violations</li>
</ul>

<div class="cta-box">
<h3 style="margin-top:0">Submit Your Case for Review</h3>
<p>Patient safety violations create liability that extends beyond typical landlord-tenant disputes. If your medical tenant is operating outside their scope, lacking proper supervision, or engaging in unlicensed practice, every day you wait increases your exposure.</p>

<p>Send me your lease agreement, tenant's license documentation (or lack thereof), and photos or observations of violations. I'll assess your duty to act, liability exposure, and immediate steps to protect your facility.</p>
