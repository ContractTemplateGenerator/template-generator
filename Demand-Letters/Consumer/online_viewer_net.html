        <div class="dl-section-title">⚖️ Legal Basis for Your Demand: Contract & Warranty Law</div>

        <p>Your right to a remedy for a defective product or service is typically founded on a <strong>Breach of Warranty</strong> or <strong>Breach of Contract</strong> under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), adopted by all U.S. states.</p>

        <div class="dl-subsection-title">1. Implied Warranties (UCC)</div>

        <p>These warranties exist automatically by law, even if the seller never mentioned them. They apply unless specifically and legally disclaimed.</p>

        <div class="dl-two-column">
            <div class="dl-info-box">
                <strong>Implied Warranty of Merchantability (UCC § 2-314)</strong>
                <p>This is the most common consumer warranty. It guarantees that the goods are <strong>fit for the ordinary purposes</strong> for which such goods are used, are adequately contained/packaged, and conform to any promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="dl-info-box">
                <strong>Implied Warranty of Fitness for a Particular Purpose (UCC § 2-315)</strong>
                <p>This arises when the seller knows the buyer is relying on their skill or judgment to select a suitable product for a <strong>specific, non-ordinary purpose</strong> (e.g., buying a specific type of paint after telling the store clerk exactly what surface you need to cover and relying on their recommendation).</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="dl-subsection-title">2. Express Warranties (UCC & Magnuson-Moss Act)</div>

        <p>These are affirmative promises made by the seller or manufacturer.</p>

        <ul class="dl-checklist">
            <li><strong>Seller's Affirmations:</strong> Any statement of fact or promise made by the seller (on packaging, in advertisements, or orally) that relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain.</li>
            <li><strong>Descriptions:</strong> Goods must conform to any description (e.g., "100% Cotton," "Waterproof up to 10 feet").</li>
            <li><strong>Samples/Models:</strong> Goods must conform to any sample or model shown to the buyer.</li>
            <li><strong>Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act:</strong> This federal law governs written warranties for consumer products, creating federal causes of action and often requiring the payment of attorney's fees if you win your case.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="dl-warning-box">
            <strong>Legal Requirement of Notice (UCC § 2-607):</strong> The demand letter itself serves as the crucial step of giving the seller/manufacturer <strong>timely and proper notice of the breach</strong>. Without this notice, your legal claim may be waived. The notice must clearly describe the defect and your intent to seek a remedy.

    <div class="dl-content-section">
        <div class="dl-section-title">📝 Essential Components of a Valid Demand Letter</div>

        <p>A comprehensive demand letter must be factual, professional, and clearly state the legal basis for your claim and the specific remedy you are seeking. It should be written as if a judge will read it.</p>

        <div class="dl-subsection-title">Factual Narrative (The "What Happened")</div>
        <ul class="dl-checklist">
            <li><strong>Product/Service Identification:</strong> Exact item name, model number, serial number, and date/location of purchase.</li>
            <li><strong>The Warranty/Contract:</strong> Clearly state which warranty was breached (e.g., "The Implied Warranty of Merchantability," or "The 90-day Express Warranty").</li>
            <li><strong>The Breach (The Defect):</strong> Describe *when* and *how* the product failed. Be specific and factual (e.g., "The motor seized on October 15, 2025, after only 12 hours of use, far below the advertised 100-hour life").</li>
            <li><strong>Prior Attempts to Resolve:</strong> List all previous communications (calls, emails, repair attempts) and the names of employees you spoke to.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="dl-subsection-title">Calculating Your Damages (The "What You Owe Me")</div>

        <p>Under contract law, damages aim to put you in the position you would have been in if the contract (warranty) had been fulfilled. You must clearly itemize the monetary loss.</p>

        <table>
            <tr>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <div class="dl-danger-box">
            <strong>The Demand:</strong> After itemizing damages, state a clear, specific dollar amount you are demanding (e.g., "$850.00 for the original cost plus incidental damages"). You must also set a firm, reasonable deadline for their response (e.g., 14 days).

        <div class="dl-section-title">🏛️ Small Claims Court: The Next Step</div>

        <p>If the recipient fails to respond or negotiate, Small Claims Court is typically the next step for losses within your state's limit (usually between $5,000 and $15,000). A demand letter is a necessary precursor to demonstrate you attempted to resolve the issue outside of court.</p>

        <div class="dl-subsection-title">Why Small Claims Court?</div>

        <ul class="dl-checklist">
            <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Rules of evidence and procedure are simplified. Attorneys are often either not permitted or not common.</li>

            <li><strong>Required Precursor:</strong> Many Small Claims Courts require you to prove you sent a formal demand letter before filing a claim.</li>

            <strong>Check Your State Limit:</strong> Small Claims limits vary widely. For example, the limit in California is generally $10,000, while in some other states, it may be as low as $5,000. Be sure your demand amount is below the limit if you plan to file in Small Claims Court.
