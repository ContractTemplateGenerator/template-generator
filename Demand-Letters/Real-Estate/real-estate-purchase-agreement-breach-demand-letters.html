<div class="sample-letter">[Buyer Name]
[Address]
[Date]

[Seller Name]
[Address]

SENT VIA CERTIFIED MAIL AND EMAIL

RE: DEMAND FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE
     Purchase Agreement dated [Date] for [Property Address]

Dear [Seller]:

You are in breach of the Purchase Agreement dated [Date] for the property located at [Property Address].

CONTRACT TERMS:
Purchase Price: $[Amount]
Closing Date: [Date]
Contingencies: [All removed or N/A]

YOUR BREACH:

On [Date], you notified me (through your agent/attorney) that you are refusing to sell the property. You stated [reason: got better offer, changed mind, market went up, etc.].

You have no legal right to cancel the Purchase Agreement. All contingencies have been removed. I have obtained financing approval. I am ready, willing, and able to close.

DEMAND FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE:

I demand that you immediately proceed with closing escrow. You must:
• Execute all necessary closing documents
• Deliver possession of the property
• Close escrow within [X] days of receipt of this letter

CONSEQUENCES:

If you do not proceed with closing within [X] days, I will file a lawsuit for specific performance seeking:
• Court order requiring you to sell the property to me per contract terms
• Damages for delay (carrying costs on my loan, storage fees, temporary housing)
• Attorney fees and court costs per Purchase Agreement § [X]
• Lis pendens (notice of pending action) recorded against the property, preventing you from selling to anyone else

California Civil Code § 3384 provides that buyers of real property are entitled to specific performance of the purchase agreement. Courts routinely grant specific performance because real property is unique.

TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. Close escrow immediately or face litigation.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
[Your Name]

[Address]

RE: DEMAND TO CLOSE ESCROW – NOTICE OF BREACH
     Purchase Agreement for [Property Address]

Dear [Buyer]:

You are in breach of the Purchase Agreement dated [Date].

CONTRACT TERMS:
Closing Date: [Date – 2 weeks ago]
Your Deposit: $[Amount]

YOUR BREACH:

The contract required closing on [Date]. You have not closed and have provided no valid excuse for delay. Your lender has approved your loan. All contingencies were removed on [Date]. You are simply refusing to perform.

I have kept the property off the market for [X] months while waiting for you to close. I have incurred mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, and utilities totaling $[Amount] during this delay.

DEMAND TO CLOSE OR CANCEL:

You must close escrow within 5 business days of receipt of this letter. If you do not close within 5 days, I will:
• Cancel the Purchase Agreement for your material breach
• Retain your $[Deposit Amount] earnest money deposit as liquidated damages per Purchase Agreement § [X]
• Relist the property for sale
• Sue you for additional damages if I must sell for lower price

DAMAGES I WILL SEEK:

If I am forced to sell for less than your contract price of $[Amount]:
• Difference between your contract price and ultimate sales price
• Carrying costs (mortgage, taxes, insurance) from scheduled closing date until actual sale
• Real estate commissions and costs to relist property
• Attorney fees

Close escrow immediately or I will exercise all remedies.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

[Seller Name]
[Address]

RE: DEMAND FOR DAMAGES – FAILURE TO DISCLOSE MATERIAL DEFECTS
     Property: [Address]

Dear [Seller]:

I am writing to demand compensation for your failure to disclose material defects in the property at [Address], which I purchased from you per Purchase Agreement dated [Date].

SELLER'S DISCLOSURE FRAUD:

In your Transfer Disclosure Statement, you checked "No" for the following question: "Are you aware of any structural damage to the property?"

After moving in on [Date], I discovered extensive foundation cracks and water intrusion in the basement. I hired a structural engineer who determined the foundation has [specific defect] that existed for years before sale.

You clearly knew about this defect:
• [Prior repair estimates found in garage dated [Date]]
• [Neighbor states you told them about foundation issues]
• [Evidence of your attempts to patch and cover cracks before listing]

Civil Code § 1102 requires sellers to disclose all known material defects. You violated this duty by failing to disclose the foundation issues.

DAMAGES:

Cost to repair foundation: $[Amount] (per attached engineer's report and contractor bids)
Diminished property value: $[Amount]
Attorney fees (per Purchase Agreement): $[Amount]

TOTAL DAMAGES: $[Amount]

DEMAND:

I demand payment of $[Amount] within 30 days. If you do not pay within 30 days, I will file a lawsuit for:
• Breach of contract
• Fraud and intentional misrepresentation
• Negligent misrepresentation
• Violation of Civil Code § 1102

I will seek compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees.

Respond immediately.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
[Your Name]

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Can seller back out if they get better offer?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
No. Once purchase agreement is signed and all contingencies removed, seller is legally obligated to sell. Getting a better offer is not a valid reason to cancel. Buyer can sue for specific performance, forcing seller to sell per contract terms. Seller may also owe damages for delay or breach.
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What happens to deposit if buyer breaches?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
If buyer wrongfully cancels or fails to close without valid contingency, seller can retain deposit as liquidated damages (if contract allows). If deposit is insufficient to cover seller's damages (e.g., seller must sell for lower price), seller can sue buyer for additional damages. However, if seller cannot prove actual damages, may only keep deposit amount specified in contract.
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Can I sue seller for not disclosing defects discovered after closing?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Yes. If seller knew about material defects and failed to disclose on Transfer Disclosure Statement, buyer can sue for fraud, breach of contract, and violation of Civil Code § 1102. Recoverable damages: cost to repair defect, diminished property value, and attorney fees. Punitive damages available if seller intentionally concealed defects. Must prove seller knew about defect before sale—mere "should have known" is not enough for fraud.
