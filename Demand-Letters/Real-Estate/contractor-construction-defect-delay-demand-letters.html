SENT VIA CERTIFIED MAIL

RE: DEMAND FOR REPAIR OF DEFECTIVE WORK
     Contract dated [Date] for [property address]

Dear [Contractor]:

I am writing to demand immediate repair of defective work you performed under our contract dated [Date] for remodeling of my home at [Address].

Contract Date: [Date]
Scope: [Kitchen remodel, bathroom addition, etc.]
Contract Price: $[Amount]
Paid to Date: $[Amount]
Balance Withheld: $[Amount]

DEFECTIVE WORK:

1. PLUMBING LEAKS: The shower you installed leaks water through the floor into the room below. This has caused ceiling damage and mold growth. A licensed plumber inspected and determined the shower pan was improperly installed and must be replaced.

2. ELECTRICAL CODE VIOLATIONS: The electrical outlets you installed are not GFCI-protected as required by code. The city building inspector failed the electrical inspection on [Date] due to this violation.

3. TILE WORK: The bathroom floor tile is uneven, with lippage (height differences between tiles) exceeding industry standards. Multiple tiles are already cracking.

4. CABINETS: Kitchen cabinet doors are misaligned and do not close properly. Hardware is loose and falling off.

Attached are photos documenting each defect.

PRIOR NOTICE:

I notified you of these issues on [Date] via [email/phone]. You promised to return to make repairs but failed to show up for scheduled appointments on [Dates].

REPAIR BIDS:

I obtained bids from two licensed contractors to repair your defective work:
• [Contractor A]: $[Amount]
• [Contractor B]: $[Amount]

Average repair cost: $[Amount]

DEMAND:

I demand that you repair all defective work within 14 days of receipt of this letter. Work must pass all required inspections and meet industry standards.

If you do not complete repairs within 14 days, I will:
• Hire another contractor to make repairs
• Withhold the $[Balance] owed to you
• Sue you for the cost to repair defects, which exceeds the balance owed
• File a complaint with the California Contractors State License Board

I am withholding final payment of $[Amount] pending satisfactory completion of all work.

Respond immediately to schedule repair.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Can I withhold payment if work is defective?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Yes. You can withhold payment for incomplete or defective work. However, only withhold amount reasonably related to cost of defects. If contractor threatens to file mechanics lien, document defects carefully (photos, expert opinions, repair bids) to defend against lien. Best practice: withhold final payment (typically 10%) and demand contractor return to make repairs before releasing final check.

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What if contractor was unlicensed?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Unlicensed contractors cannot enforce contracts or collect payment (B&P § 7031). You can refuse to pay and sue for return of any payments made, regardless of work quality. Verify license at CSLB.ca.gov. If contractor was unlicensed, you have strong defense to any mechanics lien or payment demand. Report to CSLB and consider criminal complaint for contracting without license.

<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
How long do I have to sue for construction defects?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Statute of limitations: 4 years for breach of contract (from date you discovered or should have discovered defect); 3 years for fraud; 10 years for latent defects in residential construction (CCP § 337.15). For patent (obvious) defects like poor tile work or misaligned cabinets, clock starts when work completed. For latent defects like hidden plumbing leaks or foundation issues, clock starts when discovered. Act quickly—don't wait years to sue.
