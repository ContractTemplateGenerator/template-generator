<div class="section-title">California Contract Law: Legal Framework for Breach Claims</div>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Core Legal Framework:</strong> California contract law is governed by both the California Civil Code and extensive case law. A breach of contract occurs when one party fails to perform their obligations under a valid contract without legal excuse. Understanding the elements of a valid contract and what constitutes a breach is essential to pursuing your claim and recovering damages.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Elements of a Valid Contract</div>
<p>Before you can claim breach, you must establish that a valid, enforceable contract exists. Under California law, a contract requires:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Element</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Parties Capable of Contracting</td>
<td>Parties must have legal capacity (adults of sound mind, not under duress or undue influence). See Civil Code Section 1556.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mutual Consent (Offer and Acceptance)</td>
<td>Both parties must agree to the same terms. One party makes an offer, and the other accepts it. Civil Code Sections 1550, 1565.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lawful Object</td>
<td>The contract must be for a legal purpose. Contracts for illegal activities are void and unenforceable. Civil Code Section 1550.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sufficient Consideration</td>
<td>Each party must give something of value (money, services, goods, promises). A gratuitous promise is not enforceable. Civil Code Section 1605.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Statute of Frauds:</strong> Certain contracts must be in writing to be enforceable under California Civil Code Section 1624. These include contracts for the sale of real property, contracts that cannot be performed within one year, agreements to pay someone else's debt, and contracts for the sale of goods over $500 (under the Commercial Code).
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Elements of Breach of Contract</div>
<p>To prevail on a breach of contract claim in California, you must prove all four elements:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Existence of a Contract:</strong> A valid contract exists between you and the defendant</li>
<li><strong>Plaintiff's Performance or Excuse:</strong> You performed your obligations under the contract (or were excused from performance)</li>
<li><strong>Defendant's Breach:</strong> The other party failed to perform their obligations under the contract</li>
<li><strong>Damages:</strong> You suffered damages as a result of the breach</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Material Breach vs. Minor Breach</div>
<p>Not all breaches are treated equally under California law. The distinction between material and minor breach affects your remedies:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Type of Breach</th>
<th>Definition</th>
<th>Consequences</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Material Breach</td>
<td>A failure to perform that goes to the essence of the contract and substantially defeats its purpose. The breach is so significant that the non-breaching party did not receive the benefit of the bargain.</td>
<td>The non-breaching party may: (1) terminate the contract, (2) refuse further performance, and (3) sue for damages including lost benefit of the bargain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Minor Breach (Partial Breach)</td>
<td>A failure to perform that does not defeat the purpose of the contract. The non-breaching party still receives substantially what they bargained for.</td>
<td>The non-breaching party may sue for damages caused by the breach but must continue to perform their own obligations. They cannot terminate the contract.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="success-box">
<strong>Factors Determining Materiality:</strong> California courts consider: (1) the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the expected benefit, (2) whether the injured party can be adequately compensated, (3) the extent of part performance by the breaching party, (4) hardship to the breaching party, (5) likelihood the breaching party will cure, and (6) whether the breach was willful or negligent.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Anticipatory Breach (Anticipatory Repudiation)</div>
<p>An anticipatory breach occurs when one party, before performance is due, unequivocally indicates they will not perform their contractual obligations:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A clear and definite statement or action indicating the party will not or cannot perform when performance is due</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Seller announces they will not deliver goods, buyer states they will not pay, party makes performance impossible by selling the subject matter to someone else</li>
<li><strong>Non-breaching Party's Options:</strong> (1) Treat the repudiation as an immediate breach and sue for damages, (2) wait until performance is due and sue then, or (3) urge the breaching party to perform</li>
<li><strong>Retraction:</strong> The repudiating party may retract if the other party has not materially changed position in reliance on the repudiation</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Statute of Limitations</div>
<p>You must file your breach of contract lawsuit within the applicable limitations period:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Contract Type</th>
<th>Statute of Limitations</th>
<th>Legal Authority</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Written Contract</td>
<td>4 years from date of breach</td>
<td>California Code of Civil Procedure Section 337</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oral Contract</td>
<td>2 years from date of breach</td>
<td>California Code of Civil Procedure Section 339</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contract for Sale of Goods (UCC)</td>
<td>4 years from date of breach</td>
<td>California Commercial Code Section 2725</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="danger-box">
<strong>Critical Deadline:</strong> The statute of limitations begins to run when the breach occurs, not when you discover it (with limited exceptions for fraud or concealment). If you fail to file within the limitations period, your claim is barred forever. Send your demand letter promptly and track your deadlines carefully.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Key California Civil Code Provisions</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Civil Code Section 1549:</strong> Definition of a contract</li>
<li><strong>Civil Code Section 1550:</strong> Essential elements of a contract</li>
<li><strong>Civil Code Section 1565-1567:</strong> Consent requirements</li>
<li><strong>Civil Code Section 1605-1615:</strong> Consideration</li>
<li><strong>Civil Code Section 1624:</strong> Statute of Frauds (contracts required to be in writing)</li>
<li><strong>Civil Code Section 3300:</strong> Damages for breach of contract</li>
<li><strong>Civil Code Section 3358:</strong> Measure of damages</li>
<li><strong>Civil Code Section 3359:</strong> Damages must be certain</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="tab2" class="dl-tab-content">
<div class="content-section">
<div class="section-title">Common Breach of Contract Issues</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">1. Non-Performance (Total Breach)</div>
<div class="danger-box">
<strong>Complete Failure to Perform:</strong> Non-performance is the most straightforward type of breach. The breaching party simply fails to do what they promised in the contract. This typically constitutes a material breach entitling you to terminate and sue for full damages.
</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Contractor hired to build a deck never shows up or starts work</li>
<li>Seller fails to deliver goods after receiving payment</li>
<li>Service provider never provides the contracted services</li>
<li>Buyer refuses to pay for goods or services already delivered</li>
<li>Landlord fails to deliver possession of leased premises</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">2. Late Performance (Delayed Performance)</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Time is of the Essence:</strong> If the contract states "time is of the essence," late performance is a material breach</li>
<li><strong>Implied Reasonable Time:</strong> If no deadline is specified, performance must occur within a reasonable time</li>
<li><strong>Substantial Delay:</strong> Even without a "time is of the essence" clause, excessive delay may be material if it defeats the purpose of the contract</li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Late delivery of wedding flowers after the wedding is a material breach; late delivery of office supplies by one day is likely minor</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Making Time of the Essence:</strong> Even if your original contract did not include a "time is of the essence" clause, you can make reasonable time essential by giving the other party written notice that if performance is not completed by a specified date, you will treat the contract as breached.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">3. Defective Performance (Partial or Substandard)</div>
<p>The breaching party performs but fails to meet contract specifications:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Examples of Defective Performance</th>
<th>Likely Classification</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contractor installs wrong color cabinets (easily replaced)</td>
<td>Minor breach - damages for cost to correct</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contractor uses substandard materials causing structural issues</td>
<td>Material breach - may justify termination</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delivered goods have minor cosmetic flaws</td>
<td>Minor breach - damages for diminished value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delivered goods are fundamentally different from what was ordered</td>
<td>Material breach - rejection and full refund</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Software delivered but missing several key features</td>
<td>Depends on importance of missing features</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="section-subtitle">4. Failure to Pay</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Non-Payment:</strong> Buyer or client fails to pay for goods, services, or work performed</li>
<li><strong>Partial Payment:</strong> Payment of less than the full amount owed</li>
<li><strong>Late Payment:</strong> Payment after the due date specified in contract</li>
<li><strong>Dishonored Payment:</strong> Check bounces, credit card is declined, payment reversed</li>
<li><strong>Interest and Fees:</strong> Contract may provide for late fees and interest on unpaid amounts</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>California Prompt Payment Laws:</strong> For certain transactions, California law mandates specific payment timelines. For example, contractors must be paid within a reasonable time, and construction contract progress payments have specific requirements under Civil Code Section 8800.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">5. Repudiation (Refusal to Perform)</div>
<p>The breaching party communicates, either through words or conduct, that they will not perform:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Express Repudiation:</strong> Clear statement: "I am not going to deliver the goods" or "I will not complete this project"</li>
<li><strong>Implied Repudiation:</strong> Actions making performance impossible (selling the unique item to someone else)</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty:</strong> If the repudiation is ambiguous, you may demand assurance of performance</li>
<li><strong>Your Response:</strong> You can treat anticipatory repudiation as an immediate breach or wait for the performance date</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">6. Breach of Warranty</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Express Warranties:</strong> Specific promises or representations about the quality, condition, or specifications of goods or services</li>
<li><strong>Implied Warranty of Merchantability:</strong> Goods must be fit for ordinary purposes (Commercial Code Section 2314)</li>
<li><strong>Implied Warranty of Fitness:</strong> When seller knows buyer's particular purpose, goods must be fit for that purpose (Commercial Code Section 2315)</li>
<li><strong>Breach Timing:</strong> Warranty breach may occur when defect is discovered, even after delivery</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">7. Breach of Condition Precedent</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>A condition that must be satisfied before a party's duty to perform arises</li>
<li>Example: Financing contingency in real estate purchase - buyer's obligation only arises if financing is obtained</li>
<li>Failure of condition precedent may excuse performance rather than constitute breach</li>
<li>Distinguish between true conditions and promises</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="tab3" class="dl-tab-content">
<div class="content-section">
<div class="section-title">How to Write Your Breach of Contract Demand Letter</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Step 1: Gather Your Documentation</div>
<p>Before writing your demand letter, compile all relevant evidence:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>The Contract:</strong> The original signed agreement, including all amendments, addenda, and attachments</li>
<li><strong>Correspondence:</strong> All emails, letters, text messages, and other communications related to the contract and breach</li>
<li><strong>Performance Records:</strong> Evidence of your performance (receipts, invoices, delivery confirmations, work product)</li>
<li><strong>Breach Documentation:</strong> Evidence of the other party's failure to perform (missed deadlines, rejected deliveries, bounced checks)</li>
<li><strong>Damage Evidence:</strong> Records establishing your damages (invoices for replacement goods, lost profit calculations, cost to cure)</li>
<li><strong>Payment Records:</strong> Evidence of amounts paid and amounts due</li>
<li><strong>Witness Information:</strong> Names and contact information of witnesses to the breach</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Step 2: Identify the Specific Contract Provisions Breached</div>
<div class="info-box">
<strong>Be Specific:</strong> Your demand letter should cite the exact provisions of the contract that were breached. Quote the relevant language directly from the contract. This demonstrates you have a clear legal basis and puts the other party on notice of exactly what they failed to do.
</div>

<p><strong>Example Language:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>"Section 3.2 of the Agreement states: 'Seller shall deliver all goods on or before March 1, 2024.' You failed to deliver by this date."</li>
<li>"Paragraph 5 requires 'all work shall be performed in a workmanlike manner.' The work you performed fails to meet this standard as evidenced by..."</li>
<li>"The contract specifies payment of $10,000 'due upon completion.' Work was completed on [date], but you have failed to pay."</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Step 3: Calculate Your Damages</div>
<p>California law allows recovery of damages that naturally flow from the breach and were reasonably foreseeable:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Damage Type</th>
<th>How to Calculate</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Compensatory Damages (Benefit of the Bargain)</td>
<td>The difference between the value of performance as promised and the value actually received. What would put you in the position you would have been in if the contract had been performed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Consequential Damages</td>
<td>Losses flowing from the breach that were reasonably foreseeable at the time of contracting (e.g., lost profits, additional expenses incurred)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Incidental Damages</td>
<td>Reasonable costs incurred as a result of the breach (e.g., inspection costs, costs of finding replacement goods/services)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cost of Completion/Correction</td>
<td>If defective performance, the cost to complete or correct the work</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Diminution in Value</td>
<td>If completion cost is disproportionate, the difference in value between promised and actual performance</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Damages Must Be Certain:</strong> Under California Civil Code Section 3301, damages must be clearly ascertainable in both their nature and origin. Speculative damages are not recoverable. Be prepared to document and prove each element of damages with specificity.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Step 4: Format and Structure Your Letter</div>
<p><strong>Essential Components:</strong></p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Component</th>
<th>What to Include</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Header</td>
<td>Your name, address, phone, email; date; recipient's name and address</td>

<td>Subject Line</td>
<td>"Demand for Performance / Breach of Contract" or "Notice of Breach and Demand for Cure"</td>

<td>State exactly what you are demanding: payment, performance, cure, or termination with damages</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deadline</td>
<td>Set a reasonable deadline (typically 10-30 days)</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<div class="section-subtitle">Step 5: Determine Appropriate Remedy to Demand</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Cure/Specific Performance:</strong> Demand that the breaching party complete their performance</li>
<li><strong>Payment of Damages:</strong> Demand monetary compensation for losses caused by the breach</li>
<li><strong>Contract Termination:</strong> For material breach, state you are treating the contract as terminated and demand return of any payments or property</li>
<li><strong>Combination:</strong> You may demand cure within a deadline, with damages if not cured, or termination and full damages</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Step 6: Delivery Method</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested:</strong> Provides proof of delivery and date received</li>
<li><strong>Email + Certified Mail:</strong> Send via both for immediate notice and legal documentation</li>

<div class="content-section">
<div class="section-title">Enforcement Options & Remedies</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">1. Specific Performance</div>
<div class="info-box">
<strong>Equitable Remedy:</strong> Specific performance is a court order requiring the breaching party to actually perform their contractual obligations. It is an extraordinary remedy available only when monetary damages are inadequate.
</div>

<p><strong>When Available:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Unique Subject Matter:</strong> Real estate contracts (land is always unique), unique goods, rare items</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate Monetary Remedy:</strong> When damages cannot adequately compensate for the loss</li>
<li><strong>Valid, Enforceable Contract:</strong> Contract must be certain and definite in its terms</li>
<li><strong>Plaintiff's Performance:</strong> You must have performed or be ready and able to perform</li>
<li><strong>Feasibility:</strong> Performance must still be possible</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When NOT Available:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Personal service contracts (cannot force someone to work for you)</li>
<li>When monetary damages are adequate</li>
<li>When enforcement would require ongoing court supervision</li>
<li>When plaintiff has "unclean hands"</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">2. Compensatory Damages (Benefit of the Bargain)</div>
<p>The primary remedy for breach of contract is compensatory damages designed to put you in the position you would have been in had the contract been fully performed:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Damage Type</th>
<th>Calculation Method</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expectation Damages</td>
<td>Value of promised performance minus value of actual performance</td>
<td>Contractor promised kitchen worth $50,000; delivered kitchen worth $30,000. Damages: $20,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cost of Completion</td>
<td>Amount needed to complete or correct the work</td>
<td>Contractor left job unfinished; cost to complete with another contractor: $15,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Diminution in Value</td>
<td>Difference in value between promised and actual performance</td>
<td>Used when cost to complete is disproportionate to the benefit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Restitution</td>
<td>Return of payments or value conferred</td>
<td>Paid $10,000 for services never provided; entitled to $10,000 return</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="section-subtitle">3. Consequential Damages (Special Damages)</div>
<p>Consequential damages are losses that flow as a natural consequence of the breach:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Must Be Foreseeable:</strong> The damages must have been reasonably foreseeable at the time of contracting (Hadley v. Baxendale rule)</li>
<li><strong>Lost Profits:</strong> Profits lost due to the breach (e.g., business lost during construction delay)</li>
<li><strong>Additional Expenses:</strong> Costs incurred due to breach (e.g., hotel costs when house not completed on time)</li>
<li><strong>Third-Party Claims:</strong> Liability to others caused by the breach</li>
<li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Many contracts include clauses limiting or excluding consequential damages</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Proving Lost Profits:</strong> Lost profit claims must be proven with reasonable certainty. You need documentation showing: (1) profits would have been earned absent the breach, (2) the amount of profits with reasonable certainty, and (3) the breach caused the loss. New businesses face a higher burden because they lack profit history.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">4. Liquidated Damages</div>
<p>Many contracts include liquidated damages clauses specifying the amount of damages for breach:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Enforceability:</strong> Liquidated damages are enforceable if: (1) damages were difficult to estimate at contract formation, and (2) the amount is a reasonable forecast of actual damages</li>
<li><strong>Penalties Void:</strong> If the liquidated damages clause is actually a penalty (punitive rather than compensatory), it is unenforceable under California Civil Code Section 1671</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Contracts:</strong> In consumer contracts, the party seeking enforcement bears the burden of proving reasonableness</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Contracts:</strong> In commercial contracts, the burden is on the party challenging the clause</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">5. Mitigation of Damages</div>
<div class="danger-box">
<strong>Duty to Mitigate:</strong> Under California law, the injured party has a duty to take reasonable steps to minimize damages. You cannot recover damages that you could have reasonably avoided. Failure to mitigate reduces your recovery.
</div>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>If a contractor abandons a job, you must make reasonable efforts to find a replacement contractor (but you are not required to accept inferior work)</li>
<li>If a buyer breaches, you must make reasonable efforts to resell goods (and recover the difference)</li>
<li>If an employer breaches an employment contract, you must seek comparable employment</li>
<li>You can recover reasonable mitigation expenses even if mitigation was unsuccessful</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">6. Attorney's Fees</div>
<p>In California, each party generally pays their own attorney's fees unless:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Contract Provision:</strong> The contract includes an attorney's fees clause (if the contract allows one party to recover fees, California Civil Code Section 1717 makes it mutual)</li>
<li><strong>Statute:</strong> A statute authorizes fee recovery (e.g., consumer protection laws)</li>
<li><strong>Amount:</strong> Reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable; courts may reduce excessive claims</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">7. Interest</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Contract Rate:</strong> If the contract specifies an interest rate, that rate applies</li>
<li><strong>Prejudgment Interest:</strong> California Civil Code Section 3287 allows prejudgment interest at 10% per annum for damages that are certain or capable of calculation</li>
<li><strong>Post-Judgment Interest:</strong> Judgments accrue interest at 10% per annum</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">8. Court Options</div>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Court</th>
<th>Jurisdiction</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Small Claims Court</td>
<td>Up to $12,500 (individuals)</td>
<td>No attorneys; faster process; informal; no jury</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Limited Civil Court</td>
<td>$12,500 - $35,000</td>
<td>Streamlined procedures; limited discovery</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unlimited Civil Court</td>
<td>Over $35,000</td>
<td>Full procedures; full discovery; jury available</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="success-box">
<strong>Collection After Judgment:</strong> If you win a judgment and the defendant does not pay voluntarily, you can pursue: wage garnishment, bank account levy, property liens, debtor's examination, and asset seizure. Judgments accrue 10% interest and are enforceable for 10 years (renewable for another 10).

<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What is the statute of limitations for breach of contract in California?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
The statute of limitations depends on the type of contract. For written contracts, you have 4 years from the date of breach to file a lawsuit (Code of Civil Procedure Section 337). For oral contracts, you have only 2 years (Code of Civil Procedure Section 339). The clock starts running when the breach occurs, not when you discover it (with limited exceptions). If you miss the deadline, your claim is barred forever, so it is critical to act promptly.
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What is the difference between a material breach and a minor breach?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
A material breach is a significant failure to perform that goes to the essence of the contract and substantially defeats its purpose. If the other party materially breaches, you can terminate the contract, refuse further performance, and sue for all damages including the benefit of your bargain. A minor breach is a less significant failure where you still receive substantially what you bargained for. With a minor breach, you can sue for damages caused by the breach but must continue performing your own obligations. Whether a breach is material depends on factors like the extent of the injury, whether the breach was willful, and whether it can be cured.

</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What damages can I recover for breach of contract?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
The primary remedy is compensatory damages designed to put you in the position you would have been in had the contract been performed. This includes: (1) expectation damages (the difference between promised and actual performance), (2) consequential damages (losses flowing from the breach that were foreseeable, such as lost profits), (3) incidental damages (reasonable costs incurred as a result of the breach), and (4) restitution (return of any payments or value you conferred). You may also recover prejudgment interest and, if your contract has an attorney's fees clause, reasonable attorney's fees.

</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Do I need to send a demand letter before suing?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
While California law generally does not require a demand letter before filing a breach of contract lawsuit, sending one is almost always advisable. A well-written demand letter can: (1) prompt the other party to pay or perform without the expense of litigation, (2) document your claim and the other party's refusal, (3) demonstrate good faith efforts to resolve the dispute, (4) establish the date from which interest may accrue, and (5) help you organize your evidence and arguments before filing. Some contracts specifically require notice and an opportunity to cure before you can terminate or sue.
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What is specific performance and when can I get it?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Specific performance is a court order requiring the breaching party to actually perform their contractual obligations. It is an equitable remedy available only when monetary damages are inadequate to compensate for the loss. It is most commonly granted in real estate contracts (because every piece of land is unique) and contracts involving unique goods or rare items. Specific performance is generally not available for personal service contracts or when ongoing court supervision would be required. To obtain it, you must show: (1) a valid, enforceable contract, (2) your performance or readiness to perform, (3) inadequacy of money damages, and (4) feasibility of enforcement.

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What is my duty to mitigate damages?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Under California law, the injured party has a duty to take reasonable steps to minimize damages after a breach. You cannot recover damages that you could have reasonably avoided. For example, if a contractor abandons your project, you must make reasonable efforts to find a replacement (though you do not have to accept inferior work or pay more). If a buyer breaches, you must make reasonable efforts to resell goods. However, you are entitled to recover the reasonable costs of your mitigation efforts, and you are not required to take extraordinary measures. Failure to mitigate can reduce your recovery.

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Can I recover attorney's fees in a breach of contract case?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
In California, each party generally pays their own attorney's fees unless there is a contract provision or statute allowing recovery. If your contract includes an attorney's fees clause, California Civil Code Section 1717 makes that clause reciprocal, meaning either party who prevails in a contract dispute can recover fees regardless of how the clause is worded. The fees must be reasonable, and courts have discretion to reduce excessive claims. Review your contract for an attorney's fees provision before deciding whether to litigate.
