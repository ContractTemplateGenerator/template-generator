<div class="section-title">California Law for Collecting Unpaid Invoices</div>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Core Legal Framework:</strong> When a customer or client fails to pay an invoice in California, you have multiple legal remedies under the California Commercial Code, Civil Code provisions for breach of contract, and statutory interest under Civil Code Section 3289. Understanding these laws helps you write effective demand letters and recover what you are owed, including interest and reasonable collection costs.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">California Commercial Code - Sale of Goods</div>
<p>The California Commercial Code (based on the Uniform Commercial Code) governs transactions involving the sale of goods:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Code Section</th>
<th>What It Covers</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Commercial Code 2201</td>
<td>Statute of Frauds - contracts for goods over $500 must be in writing (with exceptions)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Commercial Code 2301-2310</td>
<td>Seller's obligation to tender delivery; buyer's obligation to accept and pay</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Commercial Code 2507</td>
<td>Tender of delivery is a condition to buyer's duty to pay</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Commercial Code 2607</td>
<td>Buyer must pay at the contract rate for any goods accepted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Commercial Code 2709</td>
<td>Seller's right to recover the price of accepted goods</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Commercial Code 2710</td>
<td>Seller's incidental damages (storage, resale costs, etc.)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="section-subtitle">Breach of Contract Under Civil Code</div>
<p>For service contracts and other non-goods transactions, California Civil Code breach of contract principles apply:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Express Contract:</strong> When parties have a written or verbal agreement with defined payment terms</li>
<li><strong>Implied Contract:</strong> When circumstances show the parties intended to create an obligation (e.g., services rendered with expectation of payment)</li>
<li><strong>Quantum Meruit:</strong> Recovery for reasonable value of services when no express contract exists</li>
<li><strong>Account Stated:</strong> When debtor acknowledges a specific amount is owed after receiving invoices</li>
</ul>

<div class="success-box">
<strong>Elements of Breach of Contract:</strong> To recover for breach of contract in California, you must prove: (1) existence of a contract, (2) your performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) resulting damages. An unpaid invoice typically satisfies all elements when you delivered goods or services as agreed.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Interest Rates Under Civil Code Section 3289</div>
<p>California law entitles you to collect interest on unpaid amounts:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Type of Contract</th>
<th>Interest Rate</th>
<th>Legal Authority</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contract specifies interest rate</td>
<td>The rate stated in the contract (up to usury limits)</td>
<td>Civil Code 3289(a)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contract with no interest rate specified</td>
<td>10% per annum</td>
<td>Civil Code 3289(b)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No written contract (implied)</td>
<td>7% per annum (legal rate)</td>
<td>California Constitution Art. XV, Sec. 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prejudgment interest on damages</td>
<td>10% per annum</td>
<td>Civil Code 3287, 3289</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Calculating Interest:</strong> Interest accrues from the date payment was due (the invoice due date or, if none stated, a reasonable time after delivery). Calculate daily interest as: (Principal x Annual Rate) / 365. For example, $5,000 at 10% = $500/year or $1.37/day.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Reasonable Collection Costs</div>
<p>Under California law, you may be entitled to recover collection costs in certain situations:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Contractual Provision:</strong> If your contract includes a clause allowing recovery of collection costs and attorney fees, you can recover these amounts (Civil Code 1717)</li>
<li><strong>Civil Code 1717.5:</strong> In actions on contracts with a principal amount under $5,000, the prevailing party may recover reasonable attorney fees</li>
<li><strong>NSF Checks:</strong> For bounced checks, Civil Code 1719 allows service charges plus treble damages up to $1,500</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Code 2710:</strong> Sellers may recover incidental damages including reasonable charges for storage, shipping, and collection efforts</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Statute of Limitations</div>
<p>Act within these time limits or lose your right to sue:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Type of Claim</th>
<th>Time Limit</th>
<th>Legal Authority</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Written contract</td>
<td>4 years from breach</td>
<td>Code of Civil Procedure 337</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oral contract</td>
<td>2 years from breach</td>
<td>Code of Civil Procedure 339</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Open book account</td>
<td>4 years from last entry</td>
<td>Code of Civil Procedure 337</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Account stated</td>
<td>4 years from statement</td>
<td>Code of Civil Procedure 337</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sale of goods (Commercial Code)</td>
<td>4 years from breach</td>
<td>Commercial Code 2725</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="danger-box">
<strong>Do Not Wait:</strong> The statute of limitations begins running from the date payment was due, not the date you discovered the non-payment. If your invoice was due January 1, 2021, and you have a written contract, you must file suit by January 1, 2025 at the latest. Send demand letters promptly to preserve your rights.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Prompt Payment Act (Government Contracts)</div>
<p>If you are a contractor or subcontractor on public works or government contracts:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Public Contract Code 7107:</strong> Progress payments must be made within 30 days of billing; retention within 60 days of completion</li>
<li><strong>Civil Code 3260:</strong> Interest at 2% per month on wrongfully withheld retention</li>
<li><strong>Business and Professions Code 7108.5:</strong> Prime contractors must pay subcontractors within 7 days of receiving payment</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
<div class="section-title">Common Invoice Collection Issues</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">1. Late Payment / Non-Payment</div>
<div class="danger-box">
<strong>Most Common Issue:</strong> The client simply does not pay by the due date and may be ignoring your invoice entirely. This can happen for many reasons - cash flow problems, disorganization, or intentional avoidance.
</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Invoice sent but no payment received by due date</li>
<li>Client not responding to emails, calls, or follow-up invoices</li>
<li>Client claims they "never received" the invoice</li>
<li>Client promises payment "next week" repeatedly but never pays</li>
<li>Client's business appears to be operating normally but avoids you</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Warning Signs of Non-Payment:</strong> Watch for: delays in returning calls/emails, vague promises without specific dates, requests to postpone payment discussions, or the client avoiding meetings. Early intervention with a formal demand letter often produces better results than passive waiting.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">2. Partial Payment</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Unauthorized deductions:</strong> Client pays less than invoiced with no explanation</li>
<li><strong>"Payment on account":</strong> Client sends partial payment claiming it is all they can afford now</li>
<li><strong>Withholding retention:</strong> Client withholds a percentage beyond what is contractually allowed</li>
<li><strong>Offset claims:</strong> Client deducts amounts for alleged defects or problems without prior notice</li>
<li><strong>Short-paying:</strong> Client consistently pays 90-95% of invoices hoping you will not notice</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Accepting Partial Payment:</strong> Be careful when accepting partial payments. Document whether you are accepting it as partial satisfaction or in full satisfaction of the debt. Under Civil Code 1526, if you cash a check marked "payment in full" when a genuine dispute exists, you may have accepted that amount as full payment (accord and satisfaction). Write "accepted as partial payment only" on such checks.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">3. Disputed Invoices</div>
<p>Sometimes clients refuse to pay because they claim a dispute:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Type of Dispute</th>
<th>How to Address</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quality of goods/services</td>
<td>Request specific written complaints; offer to cure if legitimate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Incorrect pricing</td>
<td>Provide copy of contract, quote, or purchase order showing agreed price</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quantity discrepancy</td>
<td>Provide delivery receipts, packing slips, or signed acknowledgments</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Work not completed</td>
<td>Document completion with photos, reports, sign-offs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unauthorized work</td>
<td>Provide change orders, emails authorizing additional work</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Already paid</td>
<td>Request proof of payment (check number, date, bank records)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="success-box">
<strong>Handling Disputes Professionally:</strong> If a client raises a legitimate dispute, address it directly. Offer to meet, inspect, or remediate genuine issues. Document your efforts. A good-faith attempt to resolve disputes strengthens your position if you later sue. However, do not let vague or baseless disputes delay payment - demand specific written objections.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">4. Bounced Checks (NSF)</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>First check bounces:</strong> Client's payment is returned for insufficient funds</li>
<li><strong>Repeated NSF:</strong> Replacement check also bounces</li>
<li><strong>Stop payment:</strong> Client intentionally stops payment after you deposited check</li>
<li><strong>Closed account:</strong> Client wrote check on a closed or fictitious account</li>
</ul>

<div class="danger-box">
<strong>California Civil Code 1719:</strong> If you receive a bad check, you can recover:
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>The amount of the check</li>
<li>Service charge (up to $25 for first check, $35 for subsequent)</li>
<li>Treble damages: three times the check amount, up to $1,500 minimum or amount of check (whichever is greater)</li>
<li>You must first send a written demand by certified mail and wait 30 days</li>
</ul>
Writing a bad check with intent to defraud is also a crime under Penal Code 476a.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">5. Payment Plan Defaults</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Client agreed to payment plan but misses installment payments</li>
<li>Client makes one or two payments then stops</li>
<li>Client renegotiates plan repeatedly without catching up</li>
<li>Payment plan has no acceleration clause, so you must wait for each missed payment</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Payment Plan Best Practices:</strong> Always put payment plans in writing. Include: (1) total amount owed, (2) payment amounts and due dates, (3) interest on remaining balance, (4) acceleration clause (entire balance due if payment missed), (5) waiver of defenses (client acknowledges debt is valid), (6) attorney fees clause. Have the client sign and retain a copy.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">6. Client Business Closure / Insolvency</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Client's business has closed or relocated with no forwarding information</li>
<li>Client has filed bankruptcy (triggers automatic stay - consult attorney)</li>
<li>Client is insolvent but has not filed bankruptcy</li>
<li>Client is an LLC or corporation with no assets (judgment-proof)</li>
<li>Individual owner may have personal liability (piercing the corporate veil)</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Bankruptcy Warning:</strong> If you learn a client has filed bankruptcy, STOP all collection efforts immediately. The automatic stay under 11 U.S.C. 362 prohibits any collection activity. File a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case. Continuing to collect after bankruptcy filing can result in sanctions against you.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">7. "The Check Is in the Mail"</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Client repeatedly claims payment was sent but you never receive it</li>
<li>Client claims mail was lost or delayed</li>
<li>Client provides fake tracking numbers or check numbers</li>
<li>Weeks pass with no actual payment received</li>
</ul>

<div class="success-box">
<strong>Response Strategy:</strong> After two claims of lost payments, demand wire transfer, certified check, or ACH payment. Set a firm deadline. State that failure to pay by that date will result in legal action. Follow through - clients who repeatedly claim lost payments are usually lying.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section-title">How to Write an Effective Invoice Demand Letter</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Step 1: Gather Your Documentation</div>
<p>Before writing your demand letter, assemble all evidence of the debt:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Contract or Agreement:</strong> Written contract, proposal, work order, or purchase order</li>
<li><strong>Invoices:</strong> All invoices sent, with dates and amounts</li>
<li><strong>Delivery Proof:</strong> Shipping receipts, signed delivery confirmations, or service completion records</li>
<li><strong>Communications:</strong> Emails, texts, and letters discussing the work and payment</li>
<li><strong>Payment History:</strong> Record of any partial payments received</li>
<li><strong>Follow-Up Attempts:</strong> Documentation of your prior attempts to collect</li>
<li><strong>Interest Calculation:</strong> Calculate interest owed under the contract or Civil Code 3289</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Step 2: Calculate the Total Amount Owed</div>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Component</th>
<th>How to Calculate</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Principal (Invoice Amount)</td>
<td>Original invoiced amount(s) remaining unpaid</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interest</td>
<td>Contract rate, or 10% per annum (Civil Code 3289(b)), from due date to present</td>

<tr>
<td>Collection Costs</td>
<td>If contract allows, include reasonable costs incurred</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</table>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Interest Calculation Example:</strong> Invoice of $5,000 due March 1, 2024. Today is December 1, 2024 (275 days past due). At 10% per annum: $5,000 x 0.10 x (275/365) = $376.71 in interest. Total demand: $5,376.71.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Step 3: Tone and Language</div>
<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Professional but Firm:</strong> Your demand letter should be businesslike and professional. Avoid emotional language, threats of violence, or defamatory statements. However, be direct about consequences - clearly state that you will file a lawsuit if payment is not received. Firmness is not rudeness.
</div>

<p><strong>Effective Tone Guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Be direct:</strong> State clearly that you are demanding payment, not asking nicely</li>
<li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Include exact amounts, invoice numbers, and due dates</li>
<li><strong>Be factual:</strong> Describe the transaction and debt without editorializing</li>
<li><strong>Be legal:</strong> Cite applicable California law (shows you know your rights)</li>
<li><strong>Be consequential:</strong> State exactly what will happen if payment is not made</li>
<li><strong>Be deadline-driven:</strong> Give a specific date by which payment must be received</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Step 4: Essential Components of Your Letter</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Step 5: Setting the Deadline</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Standard deadline:</strong> 10-14 calendar days from date of letter or receipt</li>
<li><strong>Urgent situations:</strong> 7 days may be appropriate for long-overdue debts</li>
<li><strong>Large amounts:</strong> Consider 21-30 days to allow time for payment arrangement</li>
<li><strong>Use specific date:</strong> "Payment must be received by January 15, 2025" is better than "within 14 days"</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Step 6: Delivery Method</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested:</strong> Provides proof of delivery</li>
<li><strong>Email + Certified Mail:</strong> Send both for immediate notice and legal documentation</li>
<li><strong>FedEx/UPS with signature:</strong> Alternative to certified mail with tracking</li>
<li><strong>Keep copies:</strong> Retain copies of the letter and proof of mailing/delivery</li>
</ul>

<div class="success-box">
<strong>Follow Through:</strong> A demand letter is only effective if you follow through on stated consequences. If the deadline passes without payment, take the next step immediately - file in small claims court, send to collections, or consult an attorney for civil litigation. Clients who ignore demand letters often pay quickly once served with a lawsuit.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Step 7: What NOT to Include</div>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Threats of criminal prosecution:</strong> Do not threaten to "press charges" for non-payment (it is a civil matter)</li>
<li><strong>Defamatory statements:</strong> Do not call the client a "thief" or "fraud" unless you can prove it</li>
<li><strong>Threats to harm reputation:</strong> Be careful about threats to post negative reviews (may be extortion)</li>
<li><strong>False legal claims:</strong> Do not threaten actions you cannot or will not take</li>
<li><strong>Harassment:</strong> Do not send excessive letters, call repeatedly, or contact the client's family</li>

RE: SECOND DEMAND FOR PAYMENT - ACCOUNT PAST DUE
    Previous Demand Date: [Date of First Letter]
    Account: [Account Number]
    Amount Due: $[Total with Updated Interest]

Dear [Client Name]:

I am writing regarding your continued failure to pay the outstanding balance owed to [Your Business Name]. My previous demand letter dated [date] has gone unanswered, and no payment has been received.

ACCOUNT STATUS:

As of the date of my prior demand, the outstanding balance was $[Amount]. That demand required payment by [deadline date]. That deadline has passed.

The account now stands as follows:

    Original Principal:                   $[Principal]
    Previously Accrued Interest:          $[Interest to First Letter]
    Additional Interest Since [Date]:     $[Additional Interest]
    ----------------------------------------
    CURRENT TOTAL DUE:                    $[Updated Total]

Interest continues to accrue at 10% per annum under California Civil Code Section 3289(b).

YOUR FAILURE TO RESPOND:

Your failure to pay or even respond to my demand letter is concerning. I have attempted to contact you by [phone/email] on [dates] without success. This pattern suggests you are deliberately avoiding payment of a legitimate debt.

FINAL OPPORTUNITY:

I am providing you with one final opportunity to resolve this matter before I initiate legal proceedings. You have TEN (10) DAYS from your receipt of this letter to pay the full amount due of $[Amount].

If I do not receive payment by [specific date], I will take the following actions without further notice:

1. FILE A LAWSUIT against you in [Small Claims Court / Superior Court] for breach of contract, seeking the full principal, all accrued interest, court costs, and attorney fees.

2. REPORT the delinquent debt to commercial credit reporting agencies, which will negatively affect your business credit rating.

3. REFER the debt to a collection agency for enforcement.

PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

Payment must be received (not postmarked) by [date]. Wire transfer or certified funds are recommended to ensure timely receipt.

    Wire Transfer: [Bank Name, Routing #, Account #]
    Check: Payable to [Your Business Name], mailed to address above

This is your final opportunity to pay voluntarily before legal action is filed.

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
How much interest can I charge on unpaid invoices in California?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Under California Civil Code Section 3289, you can charge the interest rate specified in your contract (up to usury limits). If your contract does not specify an interest rate, you are entitled to 10% per annum on unpaid amounts. For contracts without any written agreement, the legal rate is 7% per annum. Interest begins accruing from the date payment was due. Always include interest calculations in your demand letters to maximize recovery.

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
How long do I have to sue for an unpaid invoice?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
The statute of limitations depends on the type of agreement. For written contracts, you have 4 years from the date payment was due. For oral contracts, you have 2 years. For sales of goods under the Commercial Code, you have 4 years. The clock starts running from the payment due date, not when you discovered the non-payment. Do not wait - send demand letters promptly and file suit before the deadline expires.

</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Can I sue in small claims court if my business is an LLC or corporation?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Yes, but with limitations. Corporations and LLCs can sue in small claims court but are limited to claims of $6,250 or less (compared to $12,500 for individuals). Additionally, business entities can only file two small claims per year for amounts over $2,500. The business must be represented by a regular employee, officer, or director - not an attorney. For claims above $6,250, you will need to file in civil court.
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What if the customer disputes the quality of my work or goods?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
If a customer disputes quality, demand specific written objections. Vague claims of dissatisfaction are often pretextual to avoid payment. If legitimate issues exist, offer to cure them while still demanding payment for undisputed amounts. Document your good-faith efforts to resolve disputes. In litigation, the customer would need to prove the goods or services were defective and quantify their damages. Often, their "disputes" disappear when faced with a lawsuit.
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What can I recover if a customer's check bounces?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Under California Civil Code Section 1719, you can recover: (1) the amount of the check, (2) a service charge of $25 for the first check or $35 for subsequent checks, and (3) treble damages - three times the check amount, with a minimum of $100 and maximum of $1,500. Before suing for treble damages, you must send a written demand by certified mail and wait 30 days for payment. If payment is not made, you can pursue the enhanced damages in court.
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Can I recover attorney fees when suing for unpaid invoices?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
You can recover attorney fees if your contract includes an attorney fees clause. Under California Civil Code Section 1717, if a contract provides for attorney fees to one party, it applies reciprocally to both parties. Even without a contract clause, Civil Code Section 1717.5 allows recovery of reasonable attorney fees in contract actions where the principal amount is under $5,000. Always review your contracts for fee provisions before filing suit.
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What if the customer has gone out of business or filed bankruptcy?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
If the customer filed bankruptcy, you must immediately stop all collection efforts (the automatic stay prohibits any collection activity). File a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case to preserve your rights. If the business simply closed without bankruptcy, you may still pursue the business entity and potentially the individual owners. LLCs and corporations normally protect owners from personal liability, but exceptions exist for fraud, undercapitalization, or personal guarantees. Consult an attorney to evaluate your options.
