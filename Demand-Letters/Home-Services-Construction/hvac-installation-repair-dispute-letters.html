<h2 class="section-title">How HVAC Jobs Are Supposed to Be Scoped and Contracted</h2>

<p>HVAC work in California requires proper licensing and written contracts. Understanding these requirements is essential to challenging defective or fraudulent work.</p>

<h3 class="section-subtitle">C-20 HVAC Contractor License Requirements</h3>

<p>In California, HVAC contracting falls under the <strong>C-20 Warm-Air Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning</strong> classification. This license authorizes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installing, repairing, and maintaining heating, ventilation, and AC systems</li>
<li>Work on furnaces, heat pumps, air conditioners, ductwork, and controls</li>
<li>Solar-powered HVAC systems</li>
<li>Evaporative cooling systems</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>License Requirements:</strong> To obtain a C-20 license, contractors must:
<ul>
<li>Have at least 4 years of journeyman-level experience</li>
<li>Pass technical and law/business exams</li>
<li>Maintain workers' compensation insurance (or exemption)</li>
<li>Post a $15,000 contractor bond</li>
</ul>
Always verify your contractor's license at <strong>cslb.ca.gov</strong> before signing a contract.
</div>

<h3 class="section-subtitle">Written Contract Requirements (B&P Code § 7159)</h3>

<p>For HVAC work over $500 (labor + materials), California law requires a written home improvement contract containing:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Required Element</th>
<th>Why It Matters</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Contractor's license number</strong></td>
<td>Proves contractor is properly licensed; contract is void if unlicensed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Scope of work description</strong></td>
<td>Specific systems, models, SEER ratings, tonnage—not vague "install AC"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Start and completion dates</strong></td>
<td>Allows you to enforce timely performance; essential for delay claims</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total price and payment schedule</strong></td>
<td>Payments tied to specific milestones; no payment for work not done</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Right to cancel (3-day cooling off)</strong></td>
<td>Allows rescission if signed at home; protects against high-pressure sales</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Mechanic's lien warning</strong></td>
<td>Discloses lien risk if contractor doesn't pay subs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Change order procedure</strong></td>
<td>Prevents surprise charges; all changes must be in writing</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Red Flags:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>No written contract:</strong> Illegal for jobs over $500; you may rescind and get refund</li>
<li><strong>Missing license number:</strong> Contractor may be unlicensed; contract is unenforceable by contractor</li>
<li><strong>Large down payment:</strong> CA law limits down payment to lesser of $1,000 or 10% of total contract (whichever is less)</li>
<li><strong>Cash-only, no invoice:</strong> Sign of unlicensed or tax-evading contractor; no recourse if work is defective</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="section-subtitle">Service & Repair Contracts vs Full Installations</h3>

<p>California distinguishes between:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Service and repair contracts:</strong> Shorter-form contracts for repairs, tune-ups, diagnostics. Still require license number, pricing, and disclosures but less formal than full home improvement contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Home improvement contracts:</strong> Full installations or major replacements. Must comply with all B&P § 7159 requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>HVAC companies often blur this line, using repair contracts for installations or adding surprise "additional work" charges. Always insist on a compliant written contract before authorizing major work.</p>

<h3 class="section-subtitle">The Sizing Problem: Manual J Load Calculations</h3>

<p>One of the most common and costly HVAC defects is improper sizing. Contractors often "eyeball" sizing ("your old unit was 3 tons, so I'll install 3 tons") without performing proper load calculations.</p>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Manual J Load Calculation:</strong> Industry-standard method for calculating heating/cooling loads based on:
<ul>
<li>Home square footage, layout, ceiling height</li>
<li>Insulation levels (walls, attic, windows)</li>
<li>Window orientation and shading</li>
<li>Air infiltration and ductwork</li>
<li>Climate zone</li>
</ul>

<strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Oversized units short-cycle (run briefly, shut off, run again), wasting energy and failing to dehumidify. Undersized units run constantly and never achieve comfort. Both reduce lifespan and increase costs.
</div>

<p><strong>How to challenge improper sizing:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Request the contractor's Manual J calculation (they should have performed one)</li>
<li>Hire an independent HVAC engineer to perform a proper load calc</li>
<li>Show the discrepancy in your demand letter: "Your 4-ton unit was installed without load calculations; proper analysis shows 3 tons was correct, resulting in short-cycling and 40% higher energy bills."</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-subtitle">Ductwork and Airflow Defects</h3>

<p>Even a perfectly sized unit will fail if ductwork is poorly designed:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Undersized ducts:</strong> High velocity, noise, restricted airflow</li>
<li><strong>Leaky ducts:</strong> 20-30% of conditioned air lost in attics/crawlspaces</li>
<li><strong>Poor return air:</strong> Inadequate returns starve the system, reduce efficiency</li>
<li><strong>Kinked or crushed flex duct:</strong> Reduces airflow, strains system</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Evidence to gather:</strong> Blower door test, duct leakage test (duct blaster), airflow measurements at registers, photos of duct runs.</p>
</div>

<div id="warranties" class="tab-content">
<h2 class="section-title">Manufacturer Warranties vs Contractor Workmanship</h2>

<p>HVAC disputes often involve finger-pointing between the equipment manufacturer and the installing contractor. Understanding warranty distinctions is critical.</p>

<h3 class="section-subtitle">Warranty Comparison</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Warranty Type</th>
<th>Who Provides It</th>
<th>What It Covers</th>
<th>Typical Term</th>
<th>Limitations</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Manufacturer Parts Warranty</strong></td>
<td>Equipment manufacturer (Carrier, Trane, Lennox, etc.)</td>
<td>Defects in materials/workmanship of equipment itself (compressor, coils, etc.)</td>
<td>5-10 years parts; often 1 year labor</td>
<td>Requires registration, proper installation, regular maintenance; may not cover labor after year 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Contractor Workmanship Warranty</strong></td>
<td>Installing contractor</td>
<td>Installation defects (duct leaks, refrigerant charge errors, electrical mistakes, etc.)</td>
<td>Typically 1-2 years; some offer 5-10 years</td>
<td>Contractor-specific; may exclude "normal wear"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Extended Warranty (optional purchase)</strong></td>
<td>Manufacturer or third party</td>
<td>Extended parts/labor coverage beyond standard warranty</td>
<td>Additional 5-10 years</td>
<td>Often expensive; may duplicate existing coverage; read exclusions carefully</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3 class="section-subtitle">When to Go After the Contractor vs the Manufacturer</h3>

<p><strong>Sue the contractor if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Installation was defective (sizing, ductwork, refrigerant charge, electrical)</li>
<li>System never worked properly from day one</li>
<li>Damage was caused by poor workmanship</li>
<li>Contractor failed to obtain permits or meet code</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>File a manufacturer warranty claim if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment component failed (compressor, coil, blower motor) after proper installation</li>
<li>System worked fine initially but component failed within warranty period</li>
<li>Contractor installed correctly but equipment is defective</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Go after BOTH if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It's unclear whether failure is due to defective equipment or poor installation</li>
<li>Contractor blames manufacturer and vice versa (let them sort it out; you just want it fixed)</li>
</ul>

<div class="success-box">
<strong>Demand Letter Strategy:</strong> In your demand to the contractor, state: "I am holding you responsible for this defect. If you believe the equipment manufacturer is at fault, you may pursue them, but as the installing contractor you warranted proper installation and system performance. You must make this right."
</div>

<h3 class="section-subtitle">Building Code Compliance</h3>

<p>HVAC installations must meet California building, mechanical, and electrical codes. Common violations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No permit obtained:</strong> Major HVAC work requires permits and inspections</li>
<li><strong>Electrical code violations:</strong> Undersized wiring, missing disconnects, improper grounding</li>
<li><strong>Combustion safety:</strong> Improper venting of furnaces, CO risks</li>
<li><strong>Refrigerant handling:</strong> EPA Section 608 certification required; improper charging is illegal and dangerous</li>
</ul>

<p>Code violations strengthen your demand letter: they're objective evidence of defective work and may trigger liability for corrective costs.</p>

[Date]

[Contractor Name / Company]
[Address]
CSLB License #: [LICENSE NUMBER]

RE: Demand for Correction of Defective HVAC Installation
Contract Date: [DATE]
Property: [YOUR ADDRESS]
Total Paid: $[AMOUNT]

Dear [Contractor Name]:

I demand that you correct the defective HVAC installation you performed at my home and reimburse me for damages resulting from your improper work.

BACKGROUND

On [DATE], I hired you to replace my HVAC system under a written contract (attached as Exhibit A). The contract called for installation of a [BRAND/MODEL] [TONNAGE]-ton air conditioning system with [SEER] SEER rating, new air handler, and ductwork modifications. Total contract price: $[AMOUNT], paid in full on [DATE].

The work was completed on [DATE]. Since then, the system has performed poorly, resulting in:
- Uneven temperatures throughout the home (some rooms 5-10°F warmer than others)
- Excessive energy bills (40% higher than before replacement)
- Short-cycling (system runs for 5-10 minutes, shuts off, repeats constantly)
- Failure to dehumidify during summer months

DEFECTIVE INSTALLATION: IMPROPER SIZING

I hired an independent HVAC engineer, [ENGINEER NAME], to evaluate the system. His report (Exhibit B) concludes:

1. **You Never Performed a Load Calculation:** You installed a [TONNAGE]-ton unit without performing a Manual J load calculation. A proper load calc shows my home requires only [CORRECT TONNAGE] tons.

2. **Oversized Unit Causes Short-Cycling:** The oversized unit reaches setpoint quickly and shuts off before properly dehumidifying or distributing air evenly. This wastes energy and reduces comfort.

3. **Ductwork Undersized for New Unit:** You installed a higher-CFM unit without modifying undersized ductwork, causing high static pressure, noise, and reduced efficiency.

4. **No Commissioning Performed:** You did not test airflow, refrigerant charge, or static pressure after installation. Industry standards require commissioning to verify proper performance.

YOUR CONTRACT AND LEGAL OBLIGATIONS

As a C-20 licensed contractor, you are required to perform work in a "good and workmanlike manner" consistent with industry standards. ACCA Manual J load calculations are the industry standard for proper sizing—not guesswork based on the old unit's tonnage.

Your contract states: "Install [BRAND] AC system to manufacturer specifications and applicable codes." You failed to meet this obligation.

Additionally, you failed to obtain a permit for this work. Mechanical permits are required for HVAC replacements in [CITY]. This code violation exposes me to potential issues when I sell the home and demonstrates your substandard practices.

DAMAGES

As a result of your defective work, I have incurred:

1. **Excess utility costs:** My electric bills averaged $[AMOUNT]/month before replacement and now average $[AMOUNT]/month—an increase of $[AMOUNT]/month. Over [X] months, total excess costs: $[TOTAL EXCESS]. (Exhibit C: Utility bills pre/post installation)

2. **Reduced home value / unmarketable title:** Unpermitted work creates a cloud on title and may require disclosure to buyers, reducing my home's value.

3. **Cost to correct:** [Engineer] estimates $[AMOUNT] to remove the oversized unit, install a properly sized unit, modify ductwork, and obtain permits/inspections. (Exhibit B: Correction estimate)

DEMAND

I demand that you, within 30 days:

1. Remove the improperly sized [TONNAGE]-ton unit
2. Install a correctly sized [CORRECT TONNAGE]-ton unit, properly charged and commissioned
3. Modify ductwork as needed to match new unit
4. Obtain all required permits and pass inspections
5. Reimburse my excess utility costs: $[AMOUNT]
6. Provide a written warranty covering workmanship for 2 years from correction date

**If you fail to perform corrections, I demand a full refund of $[AMOUNT PAID] plus excess utility costs and cost to hire another contractor.**

LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE

If you do not respond within 30 days, I will:
1. File a complaint with the CSLB for substandard work, failure to obtain permits, and violations of B&P § 7159
2. Pursue litigation for breach of contract, negligence, and fraud
3. Seek damages including cost of correction, excess utility costs, diminished home value, and attorney's fees
4. Report unpermitted work to [CITY] building department

Your license and bond are at risk. Resolve this now.

Please contact me at [PHONE] or [EMAIL] within 30 days.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
[Your Printed Name]

[Phone]

[Date]

[HVAC Company Name]
[Address]
CSLB License #: [LICENSE#]

RE: Dispute Over Unauthorized Charges and Defective Repair
Service Date: [DATE]
Invoice #: [INVOICE#]
Amount in Dispute: $[AMOUNT]

Dear [Company Owner / Manager]:

I dispute the charges on Invoice #[NUMBER] dated [DATE] and demand a refund of $[AMOUNT] for unauthorized work and defective repair.

FACTS

On [DATE], I called your company for a "no-cooling" issue with my AC. Your technician, [TECH NAME], arrived and diagnosed a "bad capacitor." I authorized replacement of the capacitor for the quoted price of $[AMOUNT].

After replacing the capacitor, the technician claimed he found "additional issues":
- Refrigerant leak requiring $[AMOUNT] to repair
- Contactor needed replacement: $[AMOUNT]
- Coil cleaning: $[AMOUNT]

**Total invoice: $[TOTAL], of which I authorized only $[CAPACITOR AMOUNT].**

I felt pressured to approve the additional work because the technician said "your system won't run safely without these repairs." I reluctantly agreed.

The system has continued to malfunction since the repair. The AC still doesn't cool properly, and I've had to call another company to diagnose ongoing issues.

WHY I DISPUTE THESE CHARGES

1. **You Did Not Provide a Written Estimate for Additional Work**

California law (B&P § 7159.10) requires that if repairs exceed the original estimate by more than $1,000 or 10%, you must provide a written change order signed by me before proceeding.

Your technician verbally quoted prices and proceeded without a written change order. This violates the law.

2. **Charges Are Excessive and Inconsistent with Market Rates**

I obtained quotes from two other HVAC companies for the same work:
- Capacitor replacement: $[MARKET RATE] (you charged $[YOUR CHARGE])
- Refrigerant leak repair: $[MARKET RATE] (you charged $[YOUR CHARGE])
- Contactor: $[MARKET RATE] (you charged $[YOUR CHARGE])

Your charges are 200-300% above market rates. This is unconscionable and suggests predatory pricing.

3. **The Repair Was Ineffective**

Your technician claimed the repairs would fix the cooling issue. They did not. I hired [INDEPENDENT COMPANY] to evaluate the system. Their report (Exhibit A) states:

"The capacitor, contactor, and coil were replaced, but the underlying issue—a failed compressor—was not addressed. The capacitor and contactor replacements were unnecessary; the compressor failure was the root cause."

You performed unnecessary repairs and failed to diagnose the actual problem. This is either incompetence or fraud.

DEMAND FOR REFUND

I demand a refund of $[AMOUNT], representing:
- Overcharges compared to market rates: $[AMOUNT]
- Cost of unnecessary repairs (capacitor/contactor were fine per independent tech): $[AMOUNT]
- Cost to hire independent technician to diagnose your botched repair: $[AMOUNT]

I will pay only the reasonable cost of the initial service call and capacitor replacement: $[AMOUNT]. I have already paid $[TOTAL PAID], so you owe me a refund of $[REFUND AMOUNT].

If you do not issue a refund within 21 days, I will:
- File a complaint with the CSLB for deceptive practices and overcharging
- Dispute the charge with my credit card company
- Pursue litigation for fraud, unfair business practices (B&P § 17200), and breach of contract
- Post detailed reviews on Yelp, Google, and BBB documenting your practices
- Report to local consumer protection agencies

Your business thrives on trust. Do the right thing and refund the excess charges.

Please contact me at [PHONE] or [EMAIL] within 21 days.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

<h3 class="section-subtitle">Fee Structure</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Contingency:</strong> Percentage of recovery (typically 33-40%); no fee if no recovery</li>
<li><strong>Hourly:</strong> For cases where liability is clear and settlement likely</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid:</strong> Reduced hourly plus success fee</li>
</ul>

<p>Many contractor cases qualify for attorney fee shifting, making representation cost-effective.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 16px;">HVAC Installation and Repair Disputes</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #374151; margin-bottom: 24px;">HVAC systems are expensive investments, and disputes often involve thousands of dollars. Whether your new system doesn't heat or cool properly, was improperly sized for your home, or the contractor failed to obtain required permits, you have legal options to recover your losses.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 16px;">Common HVAC Issues</h2>
  <ul style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #374151; margin-bottom: 24px; padding-left: 24px;">
    <li><strong>Improper sizing</strong> — System too small or large for the space</li>
    <li><strong>Failed installation</strong> — Refrigerant leaks, ductwork problems, code violations</li>
    <li><strong>Unpermitted work</strong> — No inspections, voided warranties, insurance issues</li>
    <li><strong>Warranty disputes</strong> — Manufacturer or contractor refusing to honor warranty</li>
    <li><strong>Excessive repair charges</strong> — Unnecessary parts, inflated labor costs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 16px;">What You Can Recover</h2>
  <ul style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #374151; margin-bottom: 24px; padding-left: 24px;">
    <li><strong>Repair or replacement costs</strong> — Having a qualified contractor fix the problems</li>
    <li><strong>Increased utility bills</strong> — Inefficient system running up costs</li>
    <li><strong>Permit and inspection fees</strong> — Getting unpermitted work properly inspected</li>
    <li><strong>Property damage</strong> — Water damage from leaks, mold remediation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 16px;">HVAC Licensing Requirements</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #374151; margin-bottom: 24px;">Most states require HVAC contractors to be licensed, especially for work involving refrigerants (EPA certification required). Unlicensed contractors often cannot legally enforce contracts, giving you leverage in disputes. Check your contractor's license status with your state licensing board.</p>
