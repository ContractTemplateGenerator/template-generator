    <section class="tab-content active" id="tab-overview">
        <p>Family businesses combine the complexity of business disputes with the emotion of family conflict. When parents pass away, when siblings disagree about management, or when one family member feels squeezed out by others, the resulting disputes can tear families apart and destroy businesses. Early intervention through a well-crafted demand letter can sometimes resolve these conflicts before they escalate to litigation.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <strong>The unique challenge:</strong> Family business disputes involve both legal rights (as shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries) and family relationships. A demand letter must be firm on legal rights while recognizing that these are often people who will continue to be family - and ideally continue to work together.
        </div>

        <h2>Common Family Business Scenarios</h2>

        <h3>Post-Death Inheritance Disputes</h3>
        <p>Parent dies, leaving business interests to multiple children. Common problems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One child ran the business and wants to continue; others want to be bought out</li>
            <li>Disagreement about the business's value</li>
            <li>Active sibling refuses to share financial information with inactive siblings</li>
            <li>Operating sibling takes excessive compensation, leaving nothing for distributions</li>
            <li>Questions about what happened before the parent died - was the business already depleted?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Active vs. Inactive Owner Conflicts</h3>
        <p>One family member works in the business full-time; others own shares but don't work there:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Working owner takes high salary, no distributions to others</li>
            <li>Non-working owners feel excluded from information and decisions</li>
            <li>Disputes about perks, benefits, and related-party transactions</li>
            <li>Inactive owners want liquidity; active owner doesn't want to sell or borrow</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Generational Transition Disputes</h3>
        <p>Parent is retiring or has died; children disagree about succession:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who should run the company going forward?</li>
            <li>Should siblings who don't work there get equal ownership?</li>
            <li>Is the succession plan fair to all family members?</li>
            <li>Did the departing generation make promises that weren't documented?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Squeeze-Out Situations</h3>
        <p>Majority owners use their control to disadvantage minority family members:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firing family members from employment</li>
            <li>Diluting ownership through new share issuances</li>
            <li>Eliminating distributions while majority takes salary</li>
            <li>Making decisions that benefit majority at expense of minority</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Send a Demand Letter?</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Purpose</th>
                <th>Why It Matters</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Asserts legal rights</strong></td>
                <td>Many family members don't realize they have legal rights as minority owners - your letter educates them</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Requests information</strong></td>
                <td>Shareholders and partners have rights to financial information; a formal demand starts the clock</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Proposes solutions</strong></td>
                <td>Often the first concrete proposal for resolution - buyout, restructure, mediation</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Preserves relationships</strong></td>
                <td>A private letter is less inflammatory than filing suit; leaves room for negotiation</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Creates record</strong></td>
                <td>Documents attempts to resolve before litigation, which courts appreciate</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Key Questions to Answer First</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What entity type?</strong> Corporation, LLC, partnership - each has different rules</li>
            <li><strong>What documents exist?</strong> Bylaws, operating agreement, shareholder agreement, buy-sell agreement</li>
            <li><strong>What's your ownership percentage?</strong> Determines voting rights and certain remedies</li>
            <li><strong>Who controls the business?</strong> Board, managers, majority owners</li>
            <li><strong>What do you want?</strong> Buyout? Information? Change in management? Dissolution?</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout warning">
            <strong>Check for arbitration clauses:</strong> Many business agreements require disputes to go to arbitration rather than court. Review all governing documents for dispute resolution provisions before sending a demand letter or filing suit.

        <h2>California Legal Framework</h2>

        <h3>Corporation Laws</h3>
        <p><strong>California Corporations Code</strong> governs closely held corporations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>§ 1601:</strong> Right to inspect and copy corporate records</li>
            <li><strong>§ 1602:</strong> Right to annual financial statements</li>
            <li><strong>§ 1800:</strong> Involuntary dissolution for deadlock, fraud, or abuse of authority</li>
            <li><strong>§ 2000:</strong> Buyout election in lieu of dissolution</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Shareholder Inspection Rights</h4>
        <p>Any shareholder may demand inspection of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accounting books and records</li>
            <li>Minutes of shareholder and board meetings</li>
            <li>Shareholder list</li>
            <li>Financial statements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The demand must be in writing, state the purpose, and be for a purpose reasonably related to the shareholder's interest.</p>

        <h4>Grounds for Involuntary Dissolution (§ 1800)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Directors or those in control are deadlocked and business cannot be conducted</li>
            <li>Directors or those in control have committed fraud, mismanagement, or abuse of authority</li>
            <li>Liquidation is reasonably necessary for protection of shareholders' rights or interests</li>
            <li>Assets are being wasted or diverted for non-corporate purposes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>LLC Laws</h3>
        <p><strong>California Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act</strong> (Corp. Code §§ 17701.01-17713.13):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>§ 17704.10:</strong> Member's right to information - may obtain from LLC information reasonably required for proper exercise of rights</li>
            <li><strong>§ 17707.03:</strong> Judicial dissolution for conduct that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on business</li>
            <li><strong>§ 17704.04:</strong> Fiduciary duties of managers in manager-managed LLC</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Partnership Laws</h3>
        <p><strong>Revised Uniform Partnership Act</strong> (Corp. Code §§ 16100-16962):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>§ 16401:</strong> Each partner has right to information about partnership business</li>
            <li><strong>§ 16404:</strong> Duty of loyalty and care</li>
            <li><strong>§ 16801:</strong> Grounds for dissolution - unlawful to carry on business, or not reasonably practicable per partnership agreement</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fiduciary Duties in Closely Held Businesses</h3>
        <p>California recognizes heightened fiduciary duties in closely held businesses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Duty of loyalty:</strong> Must act in good faith in the interest of all owners</li>
            <li><strong>Duty of care:</strong> Must manage competently</li>
            <li><strong>No self-dealing:</strong> Cannot put personal interests above the business or other owners</li>
            <li><strong>Fair dealing:</strong> Must treat minority owners fairly</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout success">
            <strong>Jones v. H.F. Ahmanson & Co.:</strong> California courts have recognized that majority shareholders in closely held corporations owe minority shareholders a fiduciary duty of fairness. Majority cannot use control to benefit themselves at minority's expense.
        </div>

        <h3>Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claims</h3>
        <p>When controlling family members breach fiduciary duties, minority owners may sue for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Return of improperly taken compensation or benefits</li>
            <li>Accounting of all transactions</li>
            <li>Damages for diminished value of ownership interest</li>
            <li>Appointment of receiver to protect assets</li>
            <li>Removal of directors/managers</li>
            <li>Involuntary dissolution or court-ordered buyout</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Valuation Standards</h3>
        <p>When disputes lead to buyout, valuation becomes critical:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fair market value:</strong> Price a willing buyer would pay willing seller</li>
            <li><strong>Fair value:</strong> Pro rata share of enterprise value (often used in statutory buyouts)</li>
            <li><strong>Discounts:</strong> Courts differ on whether to apply minority or marketability discounts</li>
            <li><strong>California approach:</strong> In involuntary dissolution context (§ 2000), courts generally don't apply minority discounts</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="tab-content" id="tab-disputes">
        <h2>Common Family Business Disputes</h2>

        <h3>1. Information Access Disputes</h3>
        <p>Non-managing family members are denied access to financial information about the business they own.</p>
        <p><strong>Typical scenario:</strong> One sibling runs the family business. Others own shares but are never told how the business is doing, what they're entitled to, or how their shares are being valued.</p>
        <p><strong>Your rights:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shareholders: Corp. Code § 1601 - right to inspect books and records</li>
            <li>LLC members: Corp. Code § 17704.10 - right to information for proper purposes</li>
            <li>Partners: Corp. Code § 16403 - right to inspect partnership records</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Response:</strong> Formal demand for inspection with specific categories of documents requested.</p>

        <h3>2. Excessive Compensation / No Distributions</h3>
        <p>Controlling family member pays themselves large salaries and benefits, leaving nothing for distributions to non-working owners.</p>
        <p><strong>Typical scenario:</strong> Business generates $500K profit. CEO-sibling pays themselves $450K salary plus benefits. Other siblings who own 40% collectively receive nothing.</p>
        <p><strong>The problem:</strong> This effectively excludes minority owners from any return on their investment while majority takes everything through salary.</p>
        <p><strong>Your rights:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fiduciary duty claim for self-dealing</li>
            <li>Claim for breach of implied covenant of fair dealing</li>
            <li>Demand for fair distribution policy</li>
            <li>Potential dissolution petition if pattern continues</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Squeeze-Out Tactics</h3>
        <p>Majority owners take actions designed to force minority out on unfavorable terms.</p>
        <p><strong>Common tactics:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Terminating minority's employment</li>
            <li>Diluting ownership through new issuances</li>
            <li>Entering transactions that benefit majority</li>
            <li>Refusing to provide information</li>
            <li>Making lowball buyout offers</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Your rights:</strong> California courts provide remedies for freeze-out of minority shareholders in closely held corporations. You may have claims for breach of fiduciary duty, and potentially involuntary dissolution.</p>

        <h3>4. Buyout Valuation Disputes</h3>
        <p>Family agrees someone should buy out others, but can't agree on price.</p>
        <p><strong>Issues that arise:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>What valuation method to use (income, asset, market comparable)</li>
            <li>Whether to apply minority or marketability discounts</li>
            <li>How to value goodwill</li>
            <li>Adjustments for excess compensation already taken</li>
            <li>Whether real estate should be valued separately</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Resolution approaches:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Agreed-upon appraiser</li>
            <li>Baseball arbitration (each side proposes value, arbitrator picks one)</li>
            <li>Buy-sell agreement formula if one exists</li>
            <li>Court determination in dissolution proceeding</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Related-Party Transactions</h3>
        <p>Controlling owners direct business to companies they own or benefit from personally.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leasing property from family member at above-market rent</li>
            <li>Buying supplies from company owned by controller</li>
            <li>Paying consulting fees to controller's spouse</li>
            <li>Loans to family members at favorable rates</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The problem:</strong> These transactions transfer value from the business (and all owners) to the controlling owner, diluting minority's value.</p>

        <h3>6. Disputed Inheritance / Succession</h3>
        <p>Parent dies and children disagree about business ownership or management.</p>
        <p><strong>Common issues:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Was the business supposed to go to one child or all?</li>
            <li>Were there promises made that weren't in the will?</li>
            <li>Did one child already receive their share during parent's lifetime?</li>
            <li>How should the business be valued for estate purposes?</li>
            <li>Who should run the business going forward?</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>Resolution Options</h2>

    [Company Name]

Dear [Officer/Controlling Shareholder]:

PURPOSE OF INSPECTION

[Client Name]'s purpose in requesting this inspection is to:

1. Evaluate the current value of [his/her] shares
2. Determine whether the corporation is being properly managed
3. Verify that [his/her] ownership interest is being fairly treated
4. Assess whether distributions are appropriate given corporate earnings

• General ledger
• Monthly or quarterly financial reports
• Bank statements for all corporate accounts

• K-1s issued to shareholders
• Records of all distributions to shareholders

COMPENSATION RECORDS:

        <p>Use when: Controlling family member is taking excessive pay while others receive nothing.</p>
        <button class="copy-button" data-target="template2" onclick="copyTemplate(event)">Copy template</button>
        <div class="template-block" id="template2">Re: Breach of Fiduciary Duty - Excessive Compensation and Failure to Distribute
    [Company Name]

Dear [Controlling Shareholder/Officer Name]:

I represent [Client Name], a [X]% shareholder of [Company Name]. This letter addresses serious concerns about your conduct as the controlling shareholder and chief executive officer.

THE PROBLEM

[Client Name] has received no distributions from the company despite [his/her] substantial ownership interest. Meanwhile, you have paid yourself compensation far exceeding reasonable market rates, effectively extracting all company profits for yourself.

Based on information available to us:

COMPENSATION YOU HAVE TAKEN:
• Salary: $[amount] per year
• Bonus: $[amount]
• Auto allowance/vehicle: $[amount]
• Other benefits: $[amount]
• Total annual compensation: $[amount]

COMPANY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE:
• Approximate annual revenue: $[amount]
• Approximate annual net income before owner compensation: $[amount]

DISTRIBUTIONS TO OTHER SHAREHOLDERS: $0

THE DISPROPORTION

For a company of this size in this industry, reasonable CEO compensation would be approximately $[amount] per year. You are taking approximately $[amount] more than reasonable compensation annually.

This excess - which should be profit available for distribution to all shareholders - flows entirely to you. [Client Name]'s [X]% ownership entitles [him/her] to [X]% of distributable profits. Instead, [he/she] receives nothing.

LEGAL VIOLATIONS

Your conduct constitutes:

1. BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY: As a controlling shareholder and officer, you owe fiduciary duties to minority shareholders. Paying yourself excessive compensation while making no distributions breaches your duty of loyalty.

2. SELF-DEALING: You are on both sides of the compensation decision, voting yourself a salary that leaves nothing for other owners.

3. OPPRESSION OF MINORITY: Your conduct has the effect (if not the intent) of freezing out minority shareholders from any return on their investment.

DEMAND

[Client Name] demands:

1. REDUCTION OF COMPENSATION: Reduce your total compensation to a reasonable market rate of approximately $[amount] annually

2. RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENT: Return to the company $[amount], representing excess compensation taken over the past [X] years

3. DISTRIBUTION POLICY: Implement a policy of distributing at least [X]% of net profits to shareholders proportionally

4. IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION: Distribute $[amount] to all shareholders, representing [Client Name]'s share of profits improperly retained

5. FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY: Provide quarterly financial statements to all shareholders

ALTERNATIVE: BUYOUT

If you are unwilling to operate the company fairly for all shareholders, [Client Name] is willing to discuss sale of [his/her] shares at fair market value. Any such valuation must normalize your compensation to market rates.

DEADLINE

Respond to this demand within 21 days with either:
(a) Acceptance of the demands above; or
(b) A reasonable buyout proposal; or
(c) An alternative resolution proposal

CONSEQUENCES

If we do not receive a satisfactory response, [Client Name] will:
• File suit for breach of fiduciary duty
• Seek appointment of provisional director
• Petition for involuntary dissolution under Corporations Code § 1800
• Seek damages including return of excess compensation

        <button class="copy-button" data-target="template3" onclick="copyTemplate(event)">Copy template</button>
        <div class="template-block" id="template3">Re: Demand for Buyout of Ownership Interest
    [Company Name]

Dear [Other Owner(s)]:

I represent [Client Name], owner of [X]% of [Company Name]. [He/She] wishes to exit the company and demands that [his/her] ownership interest be purchased at fair value.

BACKGROUND

[Client Name] has owned [his/her] interest in the company since [date], having [inherited it from [Parent]/purchased it/received it as gift]. For [X] years, [he/she] has been a [passive owner/employee/etc.].

REASONS FOR EXIT

[Client Name] wishes to liquidate [his/her] investment for the following reasons:

• [Select applicable reasons: No distributions despite profitable operations]
• [Inability to participate in management decisions]
• [Disagreement with current direction of the company]
• [Personal financial needs requiring liquidity]
• [Breakdown in family relationships making continued ownership untenable]

RIGHT TO EXIT

[If buy-sell agreement exists:]
The Buy-Sell Agreement dated [date] provides for [describe buyout provisions]. [Client Name] hereby invokes [his/her] rights under that agreement.

[If no buy-sell agreement:]
Although no formal buy-sell agreement exists, [Client Name] has the right to exit [his/her] investment. If the remaining owners are unwilling to purchase [his/her] interest at fair value, [he/she] may seek involuntary dissolution under Corporations Code § 1800, triggering buyout rights under § 2000.

VALUATION

[Client Name]'s [X]% interest should be valued at fair value - [his/her] proportionate share of the entire enterprise value - without minority or marketability discounts.

Based on preliminary analysis, [Client Name] believes the company's enterprise value is approximately $[amount], making [his/her] [X]% interest worth approximately $[amount].

This valuation is based on:
• [Briefly describe basis - multiple of earnings, comparable sales, etc.]
• Normalization of above-market compensation currently being taken
• [Other adjustments]

[Client Name] is prepared to engage a qualified business appraiser to determine fair value if necessary.

PROPOSED TERMS

[Client Name] proposes the following buyout terms:

1. PURCHASE PRICE: $[amount], representing fair value of [his/her] [X]% interest

2. PAYMENT TERMS: [Options:]
   a. Lump sum at closing; OR
   b. 20% down, balance over 5 years at [prime + X]% interest with monthly payments

3. SECURITY: If financed, secured by company assets and personal guarantees of remaining owners

4. CLOSING: Within 60 days of agreement on terms

5. RELEASES: Mutual releases of all claims

RESPONSE

Please respond within 30 days with:
(a) Acceptance of this proposal;
(b) A counter-proposal; or
(c) Commitment to engage in good-faith buyout negotiations

If we cannot reach agreement, [Client Name] will pursue involuntary dissolution and exercise buyout rights under Corporations Code § 2000.

    Demand for Accounting and Fair Treatment

Dear [Sibling Name]:

I represent [Client Name], your [brother/sister] and co-owner of [Company Name] following the death of [Parent Name].

CURRENT SITUATION

When [Parent Name] passed away on [date], [his/her] ownership interest in [Company Name] passed to [describe distribution - e.g., "equally to all children" or "according to the terms of the trust"].

As a result, [Client Name] now owns [X]% of the company. You own [X]% and [if others, describe].

Since [Parent's] death, you have continued to operate the company. However, [Client Name] has received no information about the company's operations, finances, or [his/her] interest.

CONCERNS

[Client Name] has the following concerns:

1. NO FINANCIAL INFORMATION: Despite [his/her] ownership interest, [he/she] has received no financial statements, tax documents, or other information about the company.

2. NO DISTRIBUTIONS: [He/She] has received no distributions despite the company's continued operation.

3. UNKNOWN COMPENSATION: [He/She] does not know what compensation you are taking or whether it is reasonable.

4. NO INVOLVEMENT: [He/She] has not been included in any decisions about the company [he/she] partly owns.

5. [If applicable:] PRE-DEATH CONCERNS: There are questions about transactions that occurred before [Parent's] death that may have affected the value of the estate's interest.

FIDUCIARY DUTIES

As the managing owner, you owe fiduciary duties to [Client Name] as a fellow owner. These include:

• Duty to share financial information
• Duty not to self-deal or take excessive compensation
• Duty to operate the company for the benefit of all owners
• Duty of loyalty and fair dealing

DEMAND

[Client Name] demands:

1. FULL ACCOUNTING: Complete financial statements for the past [3] years, including:
   • Income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements
   • Tax returns
   • Bank statements
   • Records of your compensation and benefits
   • Records of any distributions

2. ONGOING INFORMATION: Monthly or quarterly financial reports going forward

3. DISTRIBUTION POLICY: Establishment of regular distributions to all owners

4. GOVERNANCE: Inclusion in significant business decisions

5. [If applicable:] INVESTIGATION: An accounting of all transactions between you and the company (or [Parent]) in the year before [his/her] death

RESOLUTION OPTIONS

[Client Name] is open to discussing various resolutions:

• Continued joint ownership with fair governance and distributions
• Your buyout of [his/her] interest at fair value
• [His/Her] buyout of your interest at fair value
• Sale of the company to third party
• Other arrangements that fairly compensate all owners

DEADLINE

Please respond within 30 days with the requested financial information and a proposal for how to treat [Client Name] fairly going forward.

[Client Name] would prefer to resolve this as family rather than in court. But [he/she] will protect [his/her] legal rights if necessary.

        <button class="copy-button" data-target="template5" onclick="copyTemplate(event)">Copy template</button>
        <div class="template-block" id="template5">Re: Oppression of Minority Shareholder - [Company Name]

Dear [Majority Shareholders/Controllers]:

I represent [Client Name], a [X]% shareholder of [Company Name]. This letter demands that you cease your oppressive conduct toward [him/her] and that you remedy the harm you have caused.

PATTERN OF OPPRESSION

Since [date/event], you have engaged in a systematic campaign to squeeze [Client Name] out of the company on unfavorable terms. Your conduct includes:

1. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
On [date], you terminated [Client Name]'s employment with the company without cause. This eliminated [his/her] only source of return from [his/her] ownership, since [he/she] relied on salary in lieu of distributions.

2. ELIMINATION OF DISTRIBUTIONS
Although the company remains profitable, you have ceased making any distributions to shareholders. Instead, you [describe how majority extracts value - excessive salary, related-party transactions, etc.].

3. EXCLUSION FROM INFORMATION
You have refused to provide [Client Name] with financial information about the company [he/she] partly owns, despite [his/her] repeated requests.

4. EXCLUSION FROM DECISIONS
Major company decisions are made without notice to or input from [Client Name], including [describe specific decisions if known].

5. LOWBALL BUYOUT OFFER
You offered to purchase [Client Name]'s interest for $[amount], which is [X]% of fair value based on [describe analysis]. This offer appears designed to pressure [him/her] to sell cheaply rather than fairly compensate [him/her].

LEGAL VIOLATIONS

California recognizes that majority shareholders in closely held corporations owe fiduciary duties to minority shareholders. Your conduct violates these duties:

• Freeze-out tactics that deprive minority of any return on investment
• Self-dealing through excessive compensation
• Exclusion from information minority is legally entitled to receive
• Using majority control to benefit yourselves at minority's expense

This conduct provides grounds for:
• Involuntary dissolution under Corporations Code § 1800
• Damages for breach of fiduciary duty
• Court-ordered buyout at fair value under § 2000

DEMAND

[Client Name] demands:

1. Cease all oppressive conduct immediately

2. Reinstate [him/her] to employment [if desired] at prior salary and position

3. Make distributions to all shareholders proportional to ownership

4. Provide complete financial information as demanded separately

5. Either:
   a. Purchase [his/her] shares at fair value (not less than $[amount]); or
   b. Commit to treating [him/her] fairly as a minority owner going forward

DEADLINE

Respond within 21 days with a concrete proposal to remedy this situation.

CONSEQUENCES

If you continue your oppressive conduct, [Client Name] will:

• File suit for breach of fiduciary duty and minority oppression
• Petition for involuntary dissolution
• Seek appointment of provisional director
• Request court-ordered buyout at fair value without minority discount
• Seek damages for harm already caused

Your treatment of [Client Name] has been unfair. Choose now whether to remedy it voluntarily or have a court order you to do so.
