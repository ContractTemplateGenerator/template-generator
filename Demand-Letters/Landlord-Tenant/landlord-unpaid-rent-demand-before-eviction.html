<div class="section-title">California Rent Collection & Eviction Law</div>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Pre-Eviction Demand Letters:</strong> Before filing an unlawful detainer (eviction) lawsuit, California landlords must serve tenants with written notice demanding payment of rent. While the 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit (CCP § 1161) is the formal legal notice required before eviction, an informal demand letter can often resolve the issue faster and preserve the landlord-tenant relationship.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Types of Rent Notices</div>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Notice Type</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
<th>Legal Effect</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Informal Demand Letter</td>
<td>Friendly reminder or firm demand for rent; not required by law</td>
<td>No legal effect; cannot be used as basis for eviction</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit (CCP § 1161)</td>
<td>Formal notice required before filing unlawful detainer</td>

<td>Termination of tenancy (no cause required in non-just-cause jurisdictions)</td>

</tr>
</table>

<div class="section-subtitle">3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit (CCP § 1161)</div>
<p>This is the formal statutory notice required before filing an unlawful detainer lawsuit:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>When Required:</strong> Tenant has failed to pay rent when due</li>
<li><strong>Form Requirements:</strong> Must state exact amount of rent owed, period for which rent is due, demand for payment within 3 days or tenant must vacate</li>
<li><strong>Service:</strong> Must be served personally, by substituted service, or by posting and mailing</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Tenant has 3 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and court holidays) to pay full amount or vacate</li>
<li><strong>Payment:</strong> If tenant pays full amount within 3 days, tenancy is reinstated and landlord cannot proceed with eviction</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>⚠️ Strict Compliance Required:</strong> 3-Day Notices must strictly comply with CCP § 1161. Any error (incorrect rent amount, wrong address, improper service) voids the notice and requires starting over. Many landlords use attorney-prepared forms to avoid costly mistakes.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">AB 1482: Statewide Rent Cap & Just Cause Eviction</div>
<p>California's Tenant Protection Act (Civil Code § 1946.2) imposes restrictions on evictions statewide:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Covered Properties:</strong> Applies to most residential properties over 15 years old (exemptions: single-family homes, condos if owner gives notice, new construction after 2/1/2020)</li>
<li><strong>Just Cause Required:</strong> Landlords can only evict for specific "at-fault" reasons (nonpayment of rent, lease violations, nuisance, illegal activity) or "no-fault" reasons (owner move-in, substantial remodel, withdrawal from rental market)</li>
<li><strong>Relocation Assistance:</strong> No-fault evictions require one month's rent in relocation assistance</li>
<li><strong>Rent Cap:</strong> Annual rent increases capped at 5% + CPI (max 10% total)</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Nonpayment Is At-Fault Just Cause:</strong> Failure to pay rent is a valid "at-fault" just cause for eviction under AB 1482. Landlords need not provide relocation assistance or additional justification when evicting for nonpayment.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Local Ordinances: Rent Control & Eviction Protections</div>
<p>Many California cities have stricter rules than state law:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Los Angeles:</strong> Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) limits rent increases and requires just cause; tenants can pay within 5 days of 3-Day Notice without landlord being able to proceed</li>
<li><strong>San Francisco:</strong> Rent control, just cause, and strict notice requirements; 3-Day Notices must include specific language about tenant rights</li>
<li><strong>Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose, Santa Monica:</strong> Various rent control and just cause eviction protections</li>
</ul>

<div class="danger-box">
<strong>⚠️ Check Local Rules:</strong> Always verify local eviction ordinances before serving notices or filing unlawful detainer. Failure to comply with local requirements can result in dismissal of eviction case.

<div id="tab2" class="dl-tab-content">
<div class="content-section">
<div class="section-title">Rent Collection Strategy: Informal Demands vs. Formal Notices</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">When to Use Informal Demand Letters</div>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Preserve Relationship:</strong> Friendly tone maintains good landlord-tenant relationship if tenant has temporary financial difficulty</li>
<li><strong>Faster Resolution:</strong> Tenant may respond more cooperatively to informal reminder than formal legal notice</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Can offer payment plans or negotiate solutions without triggering formal eviction process</li>
<li><strong>Lower Risk:</strong> Avoids technical errors that could void a 3-Day Notice</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>First-time late rent (tenant normally pays on time)</li>
<li>Short delays (rent is 3-7 days late)</li>
<li>Tenant has communicated legitimate hardship (job loss, medical emergency)</li>
<li>Long-term, reliable tenants with good payment history</li>
<li>Situations where you're willing to negotiate a payment plan</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">When to Serve 3-Day Notice (Skip Informal Demand)</div>
<p><strong>Serve Formal Notice Immediately When:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Tenant is chronically late (repeated pattern of nonpayment)</li>
<li>Tenant has ignored prior informal demands</li>
<li>Rent is 10+ days late with no communication from tenant</li>
<li>Tenant has violated other lease terms in addition to nonpayment</li>
<li>You have already offered payment plans or accommodations that tenant failed to honor</li>
<li>Tenant is actively avoiding you (not responding to calls, emails, or texts)</li>
<li>You need to start the eviction clock immediately (e.g., property is in foreclosure, you need unit vacant by specific date)</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">Late Fees & Additional Charges</div>
<p>California law allows late fees if specified in the lease and reasonable:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Reasonableness:</strong> Late fees must reasonably reflect landlord's administrative costs and damages from late payment</li>
<li><strong>Typical Amounts:</strong> $25-$75 flat fee, or 5-10% of monthly rent</li>
<li><strong>Grace Periods:</strong> Many leases provide 3-5 day grace period before late fees accrue</li>
<li><strong>Daily Fees:</strong> Some leases charge daily late fees (e.g., $10/day after grace period)</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>⚠️ Cannot Include Late Fees in 3-Day Notice:</strong> CCP § 1161.1 prohibits including late fees, interest, or other charges in the rent amount stated on a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. Only actual rent owed can be demanded. You can sue for late fees separately in small claims court or unlimited civil court.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Payment Plans: Pros & Cons</div>
<p><strong>Benefits of Offering Payment Plans:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Avoid costs and delays of eviction (filing fees, attorney fees, lost rent during vacancy)</li>
<li>Maintain occupancy and cash flow (even partial rent is better than zero while unit is vacant)</li>
<li>Preserve relationship with otherwise good tenant</li>
<li>Avoid potential defenses tenant might raise in eviction (habitability, retaliation, discrimination)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Risks of Payment Plans:</strong></p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Tenant may default on payment plan, further delaying eviction</li>
<li>Creates precedent that tenant can pay late without consequences</li>
<li>Other tenants may see leniency and also pay late</li>
<li>Continues tenancy with financially unreliable tenant who may default again</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Best Practice:</strong> If offering a payment plan, put it in writing as a formal agreement specifying: exact payment amounts, due dates, acceleration clause (full balance due immediately if tenant misses any payment), tenant's acknowledgment they are in default, waiver of any defenses, and stipulation that landlord can proceed with eviction immediately if plan is violated.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">Partial Payments: Waiver Risk</div>
<div class="danger-box">
<strong>⚠️ Accepting Partial Payment Can Void 3-Day Notice:</strong> If you serve a 3-Day Notice and then accept any partial payment, you may waive your right to proceed with eviction based on that notice. If you want to accept partial payment, either: (1) wait until after 3-day period expires and tenant has vacated or (2) have tenant sign stipulation that partial payment does not waive notice.

RE: Reminder – Rent Payment Past Due

Dear [Tenant Name]:

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to remind you that your rent payment for [Month Year] in the amount of $[Rent Amount] was due on [Due Date] and has not yet been received.

As of today, [Current Date], your rent is [X] days past due.

I understand that unexpected circumstances can arise, and I wanted to reach out before taking any formal action. If you are experiencing financial difficulty, please contact me as soon as possible so we can discuss possible arrangements.

AMOUNT DUE:
Rent for [Month Year]: $[Amount]
Late Fee (per lease § [X]): $[Late Fee]
Total Amount Due: $[Total]

PAYMENT DEADLINE:
Please submit full payment by [Deadline Date, typically 5-7 days from letter].

You may submit payment via:
• Online portal: [URL]
• Check payable to [Your Name], mailed to [Address]
• [Other payment methods]

If payment is not received by [Deadline Date], I will be required to serve you with a formal 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit, which is the first step in the eviction process.

I value you as a tenant and hope we can resolve this matter quickly. Please feel free to contact me at [Phone] or [Email] to discuss this.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

SENT VIA EMAIL AND CERTIFIED MAIL

RE: FINAL DEMAND FOR PAYMENT OF PAST DUE RENT

Dear [Tenant Name]:

This letter constitutes a final demand for payment of past due rent for the rental property located at [Address].

As of [Date], you owe the following:

PAST DUE RENT:
• [Month 1 Year]: $[Amount]
• [Month 2 Year]: $[Amount] (if applicable)
• [Month 3 Year]: $[Amount] (if applicable)

SUBTOTAL RENT OWED: $[Rent Subtotal]

LATE FEES:
• Late fees per lease agreement: $[Late Fee Amount]

TOTAL AMOUNT DUE: $[Total Amount]

Your rent has been past due for [X] days. This is the [second/third/fourth] time in the past [timeframe] that your rent has been late. On [Prior Date(s)], I sent you [informal demand letters / payment reminders] regarding prior late payments.

Under the terms of your lease agreement dated [Lease Date], rent is due on the [1st] of each month. Failure to pay rent when due is a material breach of the lease.

DEADLINE FOR PAYMENT:
You must pay the full amount of $[Total] by [Deadline Date – typically 5-7 days]. Payment must be received by this date – postmarks will not be accepted.

Payment must be made via:
• [Cashier's check or money order] payable to [Your Name]
• Delivered to: [Address]
[OR: Online portal / wire transfer instructions]

CONSEQUENCES OF NON-PAYMENT:
If full payment is not received by [Deadline Date], I will immediately serve you with a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1161. If you fail to pay within 3 days of service of that notice or fail to vacate the premises, I will file an unlawful detainer (eviction) lawsuit against you.

An eviction judgment will:
• Require you to vacate the property
• Result in a money judgment against you for all rent owed, court costs, and attorney fees
• Damage your credit and rental history, making it difficult to rent in the future
• Potentially result in wage garnishment and bank levies to collect the judgment

I am not willing to negotiate further payment plans at this time due to your history of late payments and failure to honor prior arrangements.

Pay the full amount owed by [Deadline Date] or face eviction proceedings.

If you have any questions, contact me at [Phone] or [Email].

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

RE: Past Due Rent and Payment Plan Option

Dear [Tenant Name]:

I am writing regarding your past due rent for [Month(s) Year]. As of [Date], you owe:

Rent for [Month Year]: $[Amount]
Late Fee: $[Amount]
Total Due: $[Total]

I understand you are experiencing financial hardship due to [job loss / medical emergency / etc., if you know]. I want to work with you to resolve this matter without resorting to formal eviction proceedings.

PAYMENT PLAN OPTION:

I am willing to offer you a payment plan with the following terms:

1. Immediate Payment: Pay $[Amount] by [Date] as a good-faith down payment
2. Installment 1: Pay $[Amount] by [Date]
3. Installment 2: Pay $[Amount] by [Date]
4. Installment 3: Pay $[Amount] by [Date]

Additionally, you must continue paying your current monthly rent of $[Amount] on time on the 1st of each month going forward.

PAYMENT PLAN AGREEMENT:

If you wish to accept this payment plan, you must:
• Sign the attached Payment Plan Agreement and return it to me by [Date]
• Make the first payment of $[Amount] by [Date]

CONSEQUENCES OF DEFAULT:

If you miss any payment under this plan or fail to pay current rent on time, the entire balance will become immediately due and I will proceed with serving a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit and filing an unlawful detainer action.

ALTERNATIVE: FULL PAYMENT

If you are able to pay the full amount of $[Total] by [Date], I will waive the late fees and we can put this matter behind us.

Please contact me by [Date] to confirm whether you will accept the payment plan, pay in full, or if you need to discuss other options.

If I do not hear from you by [Date], I will proceed with serving a formal 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>⚠️ Common Errors That Void 3-Day Notices:</strong>
• Including late fees or other charges (only rent can be demanded)
• Incorrect rent amount
• Demanding more rent than actually owed

<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Can I charge late fees on top of unpaid rent?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Yes, if your lease specifies late fees and they are reasonable. However, you cannot include late fees in the amount demanded on a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit—only the actual rent can be included. You can sue for late fees separately in small claims court or include them as damages in the unlawful detainer complaint.

<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What if tenant pays partial rent after I serve 3-Day Notice?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Accepting partial payment after serving a 3-Day Notice can waive your right to proceed with eviction based on that notice. You have two options: (1) reject the partial payment and proceed with eviction, or (2) accept the partial payment and serve a new 3-Day Notice for the remaining balance (if tenant is still in default). Best practice: if tenant offers partial payment, have them sign a stipulation stating that partial payment does not waive the notice.

<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
How long does an eviction take in California?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Uncontested evictions (tenant doesn't file answer) typically take 30-45 days from serving the 3-Day Notice to sheriff lockout. Contested evictions (tenant files answer and asserts defenses) take 60-90 days or longer if the case is complex. Timeline varies by county—some courts schedule trials faster than others. COVID-19 backlogs may cause additional delays in some jurisdictions.

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Can I lock out the tenant or shut off utilities if they don't pay?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Absolutely not. Civil Code § 789.3 makes self-help evictions illegal. You cannot lock out the tenant, shut off utilities, or remove their property, even if they owe rent. The only legal way to evict is through the court process. Illegal lockouts result in automatic statutory damages of $100/day (minimum $250), actual damages, attorney fees, and potential punitive damages.

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What if tenant claims habitability issues as defense?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Habitability defenses are common in eviction cases. Tenant must prove: (1) defects substantially affect habitability; (2) they notified you of defects and gave reasonable time to repair; (3) defects were not caused by tenant; (4) tenant did not waive habitability rights. To defend: prove you made repairs promptly, defects were minor or cosmetic, tenant never notified you of issues, or tenant caused the damage. Document all repair requests and responses.

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Should I accept a payment plan from a chronically late tenant?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
It depends. Payment plans can avoid costly evictions and maintain occupancy, but they also prolong tenancy with an unreliable tenant who may default again. Consider: tenant's payment history, reason for nonpayment (temporary hardship vs. chronic financial instability), cost of eviction vs. value of maintaining tenancy, and your risk tolerance. If you do offer a plan, put it in writing with strict terms and an acceleration clause allowing immediate eviction if tenant defaults.
