RE: DEMAND FOR EMERGENCY HVAC REPAIR
     Lease dated [Date] – [Premises Address]

Dear [Landlord Name]:

I am writing to demand immediate repair of the air conditioning system at [Premises Address], which has been non-functional for [X] days despite my repeated requests.

LEASE OBLIGATION:

Section [X] of our Lease states: "Landlord shall maintain in good working order the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems serving the Premises."

HVAC FAILURE:

On [Date], the HVAC system stopped working. I immediately notified you via email on [Date] and followed up with phone calls on [Dates]. Despite your promise to send a technician "within a few days," no one has come to inspect or repair the system.

Current outdoor temperatures are [X°F], and the interior temperature of my retail store has reached [X°F]. These conditions are:
• Unbearable for employees and customers
• Causing significant loss of business (customers are leaving due to heat)
• Damaging heat-sensitive inventory
• Potentially violating OSHA workplace safety standards

BUSINESS IMPACT:

Since the AC failed, my revenue has dropped approximately [X%]. I estimate I am losing $[Amount] per day in sales. Customers have complained, and several have posted negative online reviews citing the oppressive heat.

DEMAND:

I demand that you immediately arrange for emergency HVAC repair within 24 hours of receipt of this letter. If temporary cooling cannot be provided immediately, I demand reimbursement for portable AC units I will rent at your expense.

REMEDIES:

If the HVAC is not repaired or temporary cooling provided within 24 hours, I will:
• Hire an HVAC contractor for emergency repair and deduct the cost from rent
• Seek rent abatement for each day the premises remain unusable
• Close my business and pursue damages for lost revenue
• Consider this a material breach and evaluate lease termination options

Current conditions make the premises effectively unusable for their intended purpose. This may constitute constructive eviction.

Repair the HVAC immediately.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

[Landlord Name]
[Address]

RE: DEMAND FOR ROOF REPAIR AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR DAMAGES

Dear [Landlord]:

I demand immediate repair of the roof leak at [Premises Address] and reimbursement for property damage caused by your failure to make timely repairs.

LEASE PROVISION:

Section [X] of the Lease: "Landlord shall maintain the roof in watertight condition and shall promptly repair any leaks."

HISTORY:

I first reported the roof leak on [Date – 3 months ago] via email. Water was dripping through the ceiling near the front of the store. You responded that you would "look into it."

Despite follow-up requests on [Dates], no repairs have been made. The leak has worsened significantly. During the recent rainstorm on [Date], water poured through the ceiling, flooding a 10-foot area and damaging:
• $[Amount] of merchandise (clothing inventory destroyed by water)
• Display fixtures ($[Amount] to repair/replace)
• Ceiling tiles and drywall ($[Amount] estimated repair)

Total Damages: $[Amount]

Attached are photos showing the leak, water damage, and ruined inventory, as well as a contractor's estimate for interior repairs.

DEMAND:

1. Repair the roof leak within 7 days
2. Repair interior damage (ceiling, drywall, paint) within 14 days after roof repair
3. Reimburse me $[Amount] for damaged inventory and fixtures within 30 days

REMEDIES:

If you do not repair the roof within 7 days, I will hire a roofing contractor and deduct the cost from rent.

If you do not reimburse me for property damages, I will file a lawsuit for breach of lease seeking:
• Full reimbursement for damaged property
• Lost business revenue due to unusable floor space
• Attorney fees (per Lease § [X])

Your negligence in delaying repairs has caused substantial harm to my business. Act immediately.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

<div class="section-subtitle">Sample 3: Access Interference</div>
<div class="sample-letter">[Tenant Business Name]
[Premises Address]

[Date]

[Landlord Name]
[Address]

RE: DEMAND TO CEASE INTERFERENCE WITH ACCESS TO PREMISES

Dear [Landlord]:

I demand that you immediately cease interfering with my access to the leased premises and my customers' access to my business.

LEASE RIGHTS:

Section [X] of our Lease grants me "24-hour access to the Premises" and guarantees "quiet enjoyment" of the property.

INTERFERENCE:

For the past [X] weeks, you have been conducting renovations in the adjacent suite. Your contractors have:
• Blocked the main parking lot entrance with construction equipment, preventing customers from accessing my store
• Parked trucks in front of my storefront, obscuring visibility and signage
• Created excessive noise and dust during my business hours, driving away customers
• Cut power to my suite twice without notice (on [Dates]), forcing me to close

I have asked your property manager repeatedly to minimize disruption, but the problems continue.

BUSINESS IMPACT:

My sales have dropped [X%] since construction began. Customers cannot find parking, cannot see my store, and are deterred by the noise and mess. I estimate I am losing $[Amount] per week.

DEMAND:

You must immediately:
• Clear parking lot entrance and maintain access for customers
• Prohibit contractors from parking in front of my store
• Limit noisy work to non-business hours ([hours])
• Provide 24-hour notice before any utility shutoffs

REMEDIES:

Your actions constitute breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. If the interference continues, I will:
• Seek injunctive relief requiring you to cease interference
• Demand rent abatement for lost business
• File suit for damages (lost revenue, interference with business operations)
• Consider this a material breach justifying lease termination

Cease interference immediately.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

<div class="content-section">
<div class="section-title">Tenant Remedies for Landlord Service Failures</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">1. Rent Abatement</div>
<p>Tenant may reduce rent proportionally for period premises are unusable:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Must have lease provision or legal basis for abatement</li>
<li>Reduction should reflect reduced value/usability of premises</li>
<li>Example: HVAC out for 2 weeks in summer, premises 50% unusable → 50% rent abatement for 2 weeks</li>
<li>Document business impact, lost revenue, customer complaints</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">2. Self-Help Repair & Offset</div>
<p>If lease permits, tenant can make repairs and deduct cost from rent:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Must give landlord notice and reasonable time to repair first</li>
<li>Repair must be landlord's responsibility per lease</li>
<li>Hire licensed contractors; obtain multiple bids if costly</li>
<li>Provide landlord with invoices and receipts when offsetting rent</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>⚠️ Risk:</strong> Landlord may claim tenant breached lease by not paying full rent. If lease doesn't explicitly allow self-help repair and offset, this is risky. Consult attorney first.
</div>

<div class="section-subtitle">3. Sue for Damages</div>
<p>Tenant can file lawsuit for landlord's breach of lease:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Lost Revenue:</strong> Documented sales losses due to landlord's failure</li>
<li><strong>Property Damage:</strong> Cost to repair/replace damaged inventory, fixtures, equipment</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Arrangements:</strong> Costs of temporary repairs, renting equipment (e.g., portable AC)</li>
<li><strong>Attorney Fees:</strong> If lease allows, prevailing party recovers fees</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">4. Injunctive Relief</div>
<p>Tenant can seek court order requiring landlord to make repairs or cease interference:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Used when damages are inadequate remedy (ongoing harm, urgent safety issue)</li>
<li>Requires showing: (1) likelihood of success on breach claim, (2) irreparable harm, (3) balance of hardships favors tenant</li>
<li>Temporary restraining order (TRO) can be obtained quickly (within days)</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">5. Constructive Eviction / Lease Termination</div>
<p>If landlord's breach is so severe that premises are unusable, tenant may terminate lease:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Landlord's breach substantially interferes with use; tenant gave notice and reasonable time to cure; tenant vacates premises</li>
<li><strong>High Bar:</strong> Must be severe (total HVAC failure for weeks, building condemned, complete loss of access)</li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Tenant stops paying rent; landlord cannot sue for future rent; tenant may sue for damages</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> If court finds breach was not severe enough to justify termination, tenant is liable for full rent for remainder of lease</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-subtitle">6. Withhold Rent (Last Resort)</div>
<p>Tenant stops paying rent until landlord makes repairs:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li><strong>Very Risky:</strong> Landlord will sue for nonpayment and file eviction</li>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> Tenant must prove landlord materially breached lease, justifying rent withholding</li>
<li><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Deposit withheld rent into escrow account to show good faith</li>
</ul>

<div class="danger-box">
<strong>⚠️ Rent Withholding Risk:</strong> Do not withhold rent without consulting attorney. If your withholding is deemed unjustified, you will owe full rent plus late fees, interest, and potentially attorney fees, and may face eviction.

<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Can I withhold rent if landlord won't fix the HVAC?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Risky. Commercial leases don't have the same implied warranty of habitability as residential. Your right to withhold rent depends on lease terms. If lease makes landlord responsible for HVAC and says you can abate rent for landlord's failure, you may withhold (proportional to unusability). Otherwise, withholding risks eviction. Safer: make repair yourself and offset rent (if lease allows) or sue for damages while continuing to pay rent.
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
What is "constructive eviction" in commercial leases?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<div class="faq-answer-content">
Constructive eviction occurs when landlord's breach is so severe that premises become unusable, forcing tenant to vacate. Examples: total loss of HVAC for extended period, building condemned, landlord blocking all access. Requirements: (1) landlord materially breached lease, (2) breach substantially interfered with use, (3) tenant gave notice and time to cure, (4) tenant actually vacated. If successful, tenant can terminate lease without penalty and sue for damages.

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this,event)">
Can I sue for lost business revenue due to landlord's failure to repair?
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">

Yes, if you can prove: (1) landlord breached lease by failing to make required repairs, (2) the breach caused your revenue loss, (3) loss was foreseeable consequence of breach. You need strong documentation: sales records showing decline during failure period, customer complaints, evidence linking loss to landlord's failure (e.g., no AC in summer = customers left). Lost profit damages can be substantial but are harder to prove than direct damages (property damage, repair costs).

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 16px;">Commercial Landlord Service Failures</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #374151; margin-bottom: 24px;">Commercial landlords have contractual obligations to provide services and maintain common areas. When they fail—whether it's broken HVAC, elevator outages, parking lot neglect, or security lapses—tenants suffer lost business. A demand letter documents the failures and sets up potential claims.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 16px;">Common Service Failures</h2>
  <ul style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #374151; margin-bottom: 24px; padding-left: 24px;">
    <li><strong>HVAC failures</strong> — Inadequate heating or cooling affecting business</li>
    <li><strong>Elevator outages</strong> — Extended downtime in multi-story buildings</li>
    <li><strong>Parking issues</strong> — Insufficient spaces, poor maintenance, lighting</li>
    <li><strong>Security failures</strong> — Broken locks, malfunctioning cameras, inadequate patrol</li>
    <li><strong>Common area neglect</strong> — Dirty lobbies, uncleared snow, landscaping issues</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 16px;">Your Remedies</h2>
  <ul style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #374151; margin-bottom: 24px; padding-left: 24px;">
    <li><strong>Rent abatement</strong> — Reduction for diminished use of premises</li>
    <li><strong>Self-help repair</strong> — Fix issues and deduct from rent (check lease first)</li>
    <li><strong>Business interruption</strong> — Lost profits from service failures</li>
    <li><strong>Lease termination</strong> — For material breaches</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 16px;">Documentation Tips</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #374151; margin-bottom: 24px;">Keep written records of every complaint and the landlord's response (or lack thereof). Document business impact—cancelled appointments, employee complaints, customer feedback. Temperature logs for HVAC issues. Security incident reports. This evidence supports your demand.</p>
