<p>The numbers don’t lie; more and more people are getting into  cryptocurrency than ever before &#8211; Naturally, this means more people are  trading on exchanges and exploring the ever-expanding list of investment  methods, on varying protocols, and with traditional or innovative  approaches. This has given rise to a new crop of crypto exchange  products that push the boundaries of how cryptocurrency can be leveraged  whilst offering more convenient ways to trade crypto and make a profit.</p>
<p>While  the crypto exchange sector is currently going through a metamorphosis,  some exchange products that have dominated local markets are now aiming  at taking center stage and breaking out into the global market, with  their eyes set on world domination! Here are the top 5 crypto exchange  products to keep an eye out for this summer, which might soon be  household names&#8230; <span></span></p>
<p><a name='more'></a></p>
<p><b><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://bit2me.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1) Bit2Me </a></b><br /> These days, consumers have to manage multiple apps, platforms, and  wallets and keep ahead of regulatory and legislative changes. To this  end, Spain’s largest Crypto Exchange &amp; Service Platform Bit2Me help  any entity in the blockchain universe to access and use crypto more  efficiently. Moreover, Bit2Me’s principal objective is to render the  traditional finance sector obsolete through the use of technology.  Offering products such as the Bit2me Wallet, Academy, Card, OTC, and  Trade, Bit2Me is a one-stop solution that is more than just an exchange &#8211;  it is an ecosystem.</p>
<p>Bit2Me tops this list as they are currently running their <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="http://bit2me.com/token" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ICO of their internal utility token B2M</a>,  which will give users unparalleled benefits across Bit2Me’s suite of  services. Bit2Me’s goal is to break out onto the global stage with their  fundraising, which will begin the Public Sale phase 1 on 6th September.  B2M will also list on Bittrex in the coming months, improving global  access to Bit2Me’s platform.</p>
<p><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://adax.pro/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>2) ADAX.Pro</strong></a><br /> Perhaps the only thing that has grown in popularity as fast as  cryptocurrency itself is decentralized finance (DeFi), which has given  crypto users access to more instant liquidity and control than ever  before. This is the principle on which ADAX.Pro was founded.</p>
<p>ADAX.Pro  is both a non-custodial and decentralized protocol, meaning that users  can trade tokens without having to give up their private keys or access  to their tokens. Additionally, no order books are used on ADAX.Pro with  one of its biggest priorities being the elimination of middlemen from  all transactions. The platform works exclusively on the Cardano  ecosystem and uses a Cardano ERC20 converter to make sure that tokens  can be converted with ease. ADAX launched their own token recently,  which is now <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://exmarkets.com/trade/adax-usdt" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">trading on ExMarkets</a>.</p>
<p><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://bancor.network/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>3) Bancor</strong></a><br /> When it comes to trading strategies through using decentralized  exchanges, a lot of the focus is on trading tokens and making a profit  when the market rallies. Bancor, while it allows users to trade tokens  with no sign-up or registration, also enables users to stay long in  their tokens by staking them in liquidity mining pools. This involves  the user voluntarily depositing their tokens for a certain amount of  time and earning not only trading fees, but also rewards, while being  protected against <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22?gi=56c1e49c9fa7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">impermanent loss</a>.</p>
<p>Bancor  is open-source which means that there are no barriers to entry, it’s  easier to use, has audited contracts and helps users remain anonymous  (given the lack of need to sign up or register on the platform). This is  indicative of the market’s current trajectory — where we see users  frequent decentralized exchanges over centralized ones for control and  utility of their tokens.</p>
<p><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.viridianexchange.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>4) Viridian Exchange </strong></a><br /> People have been trading physical collectible cards for decades now but  Viridian exchange is taking things a step further by tapping into the  power of blockchain technology, specifically non-fungible tokens, which  are very popular at the moment.</p>
<p>All users need to do is snap and  ship their cards to the exchange’s warehouse facility. Then a digital  representation of the card (and NFT) is created and can be bought and  sold online. This not only ensures the authenticity of the asset being  traded but also warrants proper storage and delivery of the asset when  the time comes. Viridian Exchange is ultimately working to blend the old  with the new.</p>
<p><strong><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.delta.exchange/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">5) Delta Exchange </a></strong></p>
<p>Crypto  derivatives trading is getting an upgrade with Delta Exchange and its  host of trading options including perpetual swaps, futures, options,  Calendar Spreads, and Interest Rate Swaps. With over 70 tokens in its  roster including bitcoin and ether and up to 100 times leverage, all  your derivatives trading needs can be met in one place. You don’t need  to be a master trader to get started on Delta Exchange thanks to their <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.delta.exchange/invest/robo-strategies" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">robot trading strategies</a> which include Momentum Strategies, Arbitrage Strategies, and AMM  (Automated Market Makers) strategies. You only need to deploy your  crypto and watch your yield grow over time.<br /> For those who are more interested in options-based <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.delta.exchange/de/invest/yield-strategies" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">yield strategies</a>,  the exchange offers Enhanced Yield BTC, Enhanced Yield ETH, and  Enhanced Yield USDT. And with 24/7 customer support, you'll never be  left without guidance or help.</p>
<p>For crypto exchanges operating in the US, understanding <a href="https://terms.law/Trading-Legal/guides/msb-registration.html">FinCEN MSB registration requirements</a> is essential for regulatory compliance.</p>
