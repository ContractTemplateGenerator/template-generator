<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-weight:400;">What makes an average investor successful and rich in the long run is their ability to spot great stocks when they are cheap.</span></p>
<p>Everyone  wants to buy Tesla, Amazon, Facebook and Google today. But those who  piled into these stocks when they were cheap are rich today. That’s why  we decided to share some stocks with long-term growth potential trading  at around their 52-week lows.</p>
<div class="left top-left-ad"> </div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Inflation  fears, a crackdown against dual-listed companies in China, and the  spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 in the past few weeks have all  impacted the stock market, sending the share prices of some stocks  plunging to 52-week lows as investors dump growth and cyclical stocks in  anticipation of an incoming bear market and load up on value offerings.  However, for those who are smart enough to take advantage of these  uncertain conditions, even some firms trading at 52-week lows can offer  handsome returns in the coming months. <span></span></span></p>
<p><a name='more'></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Some of the best stocks in this category include Erie Indemnity Company (NASDAQ: </span><a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/erie%20indemnity%20co/922621/"><span style="font-weight:400;">ERIE</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">), Credicorp Ltd. (NYSE: </span><a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/credicorp%20ltd/1001290/"><span style="font-weight:400;">BAP</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">), and Proto Labs, Inc. (NYSE: </span><a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/proto%20labs%20inc/1443669/"><span style="font-weight:400;">PRLB</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">),  among others. These are discussed in detail below. Investors should  note that a bear market only happens when the S&amp;P 500, largely  recognized as a benchmark for the whole business industry, declines in  value by 20% from a previous peak. Since this hasn’t happened and  federal officials have dismissed concerns about another economic crisis,  most of the bear-related worries seem unfounded. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-weight:400;">This  means that many companies that have been trading at cheap prices  because of concerns around lockdowns and soaring commodity prices could  soon begin an ascent back towards the top. Wall Street indexes are often  a good indicator of overall economic conditions. By late July, 124  firms on the S&amp;P 500 had reported quarterly earnings and more than  88% of them beat market estimates, according to Refinitiv. On July 27,  the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 19 points, the S&amp;P 500 was  up 7 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 10 points. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-weight:400;">All  these indicators lend credence to the notion that present uncertainty  is not going to hinder the post-pandemic economic recovery. As the  recovery accelerates, the finance world is already adapting to how the  pandemic transformed the way business is conducted. The entire hedge  fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial  landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during  which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of  the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was  able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that  outperformed the S&amp;P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points  since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly  newsletter’s stock picks returned 197.2%, vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our  stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points  (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a  select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed  the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks  since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th. That’s why  we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that  investors should pay attention to.

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_965334" style="width:750px;"><span style="font-weight:400;">With  this context in mind, here is our list of the 10 best 52-week low  stocks to buy now. These were ranked keeping in mind the price of the  stock, analyst ratings, business fundamentals, and hedge fund sentiment  around each. It is pertinent to mention that since these stocks are at  or near their 52-week lows, most of them do not have positive analyst  ratings and have had their price targets reduced recently. </span></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-weight:400;">However,  the long-term outlook on these remains positive and the pullback in  price could represent a buying opportunity for shrewd investors. Hence,  these are the referred to as the ‘best’ 52-week low stocks to buy now. </span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-weight:400;">“Nevertheless,  our partners at Giverny Capital Inc. in Montreal have owned Autohome  for some time and we’re persuaded they’ve identified a terrific  business. Autohome operates the leading auto information and listings  website in China. The Chinese new car market is considerably larger than  the US market in terms of units. Plus, there are more car brands in  China than in the West and consumers are less familiar with them, as  many households are just now buying their first car. That creates great  demand for unbiased information about cars. Autohome has 39 million  average daily users, and more 90 carmakers pay to advertise on its  sites.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-weight:400;">While  the primary business is information about new cars, the used car market  could become very important over time. In the US, roughly 2.5 used cars  are sold each year for every new car. In China, the ratio is the  opposite. As more people own cars in China, and as the country gets  wealthier, the used car market should grow rapidly. Bloomberg estimates  the used car market in China should double in size over the next five  years. We think Autohome should be the leader there, too.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Finally,  Autohome is majority-owned and managed by the Ping An insurance  company. We view Ping An as one of the best companies in China and among  the most reliable fiduciaries we could choose there. Autohome grew  earnings by 26% per year from 2016-2019. The business is growing a bit  slower during the pandemic, but earnings should rise about 12% in 2021,  per Wall Street consensus. The company earns high returns on capital and  has roughly $2 billion in net cash, or one-sixth of its market  capitalization. We paid a high-teens multiple of 2021 earnings estimates  for our shares.”</span></p>
