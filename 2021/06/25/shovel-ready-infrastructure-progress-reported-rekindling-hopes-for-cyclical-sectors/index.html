<p>&#8212; </p>
<p>While you never want to spike the ball on the five-yard  line, the stock market has a green tint this morning amid news of  progress on an infrastructure deal. It’s got the market excited and is  probably the main impetus for stocks being up so much overnight.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-ylQ07i-7Zq4/YNVAKW0WkbI/AAAAAAAAWuQ/LFJfAiFPyLoKGo13-5qjU2FRsU22FTVqQCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/cellphone-6283756.jpg?ssl=1" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" border="0" height="426" src="https://i0.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-ylQ07i-7Zq4/YNVAKW0WkbI/AAAAAAAAWuQ/LFJfAiFPyLoKGo13-5qjU2FRsU22FTVqQCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h426/cellphone-6283756.jpg?resize=640%2C426&#038;ssl=1" width="640" /></a></div>
</p>
<p>Obviously, people have had their infrastructure hopes dashed many  times and this might end up being another. For now, the news might help  power some of the cyclical sectors like Industrials and Materials that  conceivably would benefit from billions of dollars in government  spending on highways, railroads, airports, and other  infrastructure-related projects. </p>
<p>This morning also brings the latest updates on jobless claims and  gross domestic product. Later today, investors will get a look at  earnings from <b>Nike</b> <span class="bztwpositive"><a class="ticker bztwwidgethover" href="https://benzinga.com/stock/nke#NYSE" id="bztwgreenarrow" title="NKE"><span class="arrow-up--tw"></span>NKE 0.37%</a></span> and <b>FedEx </b><span class="bztwpositive"><a class="ticker bztwwidgethover" href="https://benzinga.com/stock/fdx#NYSE" id="bztwgreenarrow" title="FDX"><span class="arrow-up--tw"></span>FDX 2.15%</a></span>, followed by another read on inflation tomorrow. </p>
<p>Initial jobless claims disappointed for the second week in a row at  411,000, well above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of 380,000.  Progress here appears to be flatlining a bit after weeks of the numbers  falling. That’s not bullish heading into next week’s monthly payrolls  report. </p>
<p>On gross domestic product, the government’s final Q1 estimate stayed at 6.4%, so no major surprises there. </p>

<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Life_Moves_Pretty_Fast_And_So_Does_Market_Narrative"></span>Life Moves Pretty Fast, And So Does Market Narrative<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>It’s amazing how quickly the narrative changes in this market. Last  week at this time there was a wall of worry around the Fed, and this  week there’s a feeling that “all is good” and we’re on the verge of  setting records. It shows you there isn’t a great deal of conviction  either way and how investors need to be careful. More than ever, if  you’re trading this market you need to have your plan and know the  timeframe of your investments and your risk tolerance.<span></span></p>
<p><a name='more'></a></p>
<p>The biggest debate in the market is if inflation is transitory or  permanent. As that debate plays out and more data arrive, it wouldn’t be  surprising to see the current pattern of equity market trading without  great conviction continue until earnings start in mid-July. </p>
<p>Remember, too, that in the period we’re in with the last Fed meeting  receding and earnings still weeks ahead, data in the coming days might  not get the same kind of attention as it would right before a Fed  gathering. The exception, of course, is next Friday’s June payrolls  report, which we’ll discuss a lot in the near future.</p>
<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Busy_Earnings_Afternoon_Coming_Right_Up"></span>Busy Earnings Afternoon Coming Right Up<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>Earnings season doesn’t officially kick-off for a few weeks, but the  earnings landscape briefly gets more cluttered after the close today.  NKE and<b> </b>FDX lead the charge as they both prepare to open their books. <a href="https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/market-news/record-peak-getting-close-18697" rel="nofollow sponsored">We discussed NKE a bit yesterday</a>, so let’s turn to FDX.</p>
<p>FDX had a solid quarter last time out, assisted by volume gains in  its U.S. domestic residential package and international priority  services, as well as pricing initiatives. Strong economic growth so far  this year could provide a tailwind for the package company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, air passenger traffic is starting to perk up a bit, which  might mean more cargo capacity putting pressure on pricing power,  analysts say. FDX might get asked on its call about its rate of on-time  delivery, and also its projections for any change in fundamentals-based  on more people getting back to work instead of working from home.</p>
<p><b>Blackberry</b> <span class="bztwnegative"><a class="ticker bztwwidgethover" href="https://benzinga.com/stock/bb#NYSE" id="bztwredarrow" title="BB"><span class="arrow-down--tw"></span>BB 3.54%</a></span> also reports this afternoon, and <b>CarMax</b> <span class="bztwpositive"><a class="ticker bztwwidgethover" href="https://benzinga.com/stock/kmx#NYSE" id="bztwgreenarrow" title="KMX"><span class="arrow-up--tw"></span>KMX 0.97%</a></span> pulls up tomorrow morning. Stay tuned. </p>
<p>The crude rally continued earlier this week even though prices have  now drawn back a bit from Wednesday’s intraday three-year highs above  $74 a barrel. Reports that OPEC and Russia might be considering a little  more production could be weighing on crude this morning as prices fell  below $73. </p>
<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="As_Major_Indices_Lack_Pattern_Focus_Turns_More_To_Single_Stocks"></span>As Major Indices Lack Pattern, Focus Turns More To Single Stocks<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>Looking back at yesterday’s Wall Street action, it was about as  exciting as watching beige paint dry. The Tech stocks tended to do best,  along with small-caps. There’s really no pattern to this, with  cyclicals and growth areas like Tech trading places over and over the  last few weeks. </p>
<p>Low volume was a feature yesterday, and technically it was another disappointment for the bulls as the <b>S&amp;P 500 Index</b> (SPX)  failed for the second consecutive day to take out the old high of 4257.  There’s nothing super-magic about that particular level, but buying  just seemed to dry up the last two sessions when investors saw the  record-high approach. </p>
<p>Lack of a major rally or downturn in the big indices could speak to a  pattern sometimes seen when there’s been a Fed meeting and earnings lie  straight ahead. The Fed has been the story the last couple of weeks,  and we do get what could be interesting earnings from FDX and NKE later  today, but overall we’re out of the earnings cycle. People start looking  for something to trade but there’s no big story, so you see more  individual stocks having good or not-so-good days. </p>
<p>People are potentially looking for an earnings story that can make  them want to own a particular stock over the long-term, or maybe they  want some momentum into earnings with a stock but not necessarily past  that.</p>
<p>Right now we’re in a pattern where some of the biggest stocks, like  “FAANGs,” are doing well. Overall, though, fewer stocks are doing better  in the <b>Nasdaq</b> (COMP: GIDS). As an investor, you have  to decide if a rising tide will eventually lift all boats or not.  Because these big stocks can keep doing well for a few weeks or months,  but at some point they’ll lose momentum and the question is whether they  bring smaller companies along for the ride before running out of  steam. </p>
<p>Besides today’s initial jobless claims, there’s key inflation data  due tomorrow with May Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices.  That’s a report the Fed follows closely. As we noted yesterday,  consensus on Wall Street is for a 0.6% rise in core PCE prices, down  from 0.7% a month earlier but still expected to be up sharply from a  year ago. Also tomorrow morning, University of Michigan consumer  sentiment is on tap. </p>
<p>Today’s GDP data is a final look back at Q1. More important now is  what to expect for Q2, even though the first government estimate is  weeks away. The Atlanta Fed’s GDP Now indicator recently pointed to  10.3% growth in Q2, but that gets updated today. One question is whether  the estimate might tip a bit lower due to the recent soft housing data.</p>

<p><b>CHART OF THE DAY:  </b><b>BREATHER FOR COMMODITIES.</b> At  least some commodities, including lumber futures (/LBS—candlestick) and  copper (/HG—purple line) have come down sharply from recent highs,  though copper did tick up a bit this week. Data Source: CME Group. Chart  source: The <a href="https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim.page" rel="nofollow sponsored">thinkorswim® platform</a>. <i>For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.</i>  </p>
<p><b>Checking The Mid-Year Scorecard: </b>It’s almost  mid-year, meaning it might make sense to take a look at the current  standings. The SPX has had a pretty good start to 2021, even if it’s  been kind of flat since mid-April. Its nearly 13% gains through  Wednesday would represent a great full year, and we’re not even half  done. Energy leads all S&amp;P sectors with an amazing 43% gain, which  only partly reflects how battered down that sector had been for years  even pre-Covid. </p>
<p>All that doesn’t necessarily mean a thing for the road ahead,  obviously, but it might show that strong Q1 earnings actually translated  to market gains. Many analysts look for even better Q2 earnings growth,  but the year-over-year comparisons could be pretty easy due to the  pandemic last year, so it’s unclear how much investors will reward  companies for participation.</p>
<p>With 10.8% gains for the year, the Tech-heavy <b>Nasdaq 100</b> (NDX)  has caught up a bit with the SPX over the last few weeks. Earlier in  2021, relative weakness in Tech stocks perhaps reflected investors’  bigger appetite for so-called “value” stocks over growth, a tug-of-war  that continues to play out and might keep going for a while. Energy,  Financials, Materials, and Industrials are some of the “cyclical”  sectors driving the value emphasis, all of them outpacing Info Tech  year-to-date. It’s a major change from the 2017–2020 period when Tech  led and everyone else kind of wobbled along. The growth vs. value  tug-of-war doesn’t show any signs of winding down yet, by the way. </p>
<p><b>Let’s Get Small:</b> Meanwhile, the <b>Russell 2000 Index </b>(RUT)  of small-caps leads everyone with 16.6% gains, though that’s down a bit  from where it was a couple of weeks ago. Its strength doesn’t seem too  surprising considering the old adage that smaller stocks, which tend to  have a more domestic focus, often do well in a recovering economy. Also,  the “meme” stock rally that catapulted shares of smaller companies  like <b>GameStop </b><span class="bztwnegative"><a class="ticker bztwwidgethover" href="https://benzinga.com/stock/gme#NYSE" id="bztwredarrow" title="GME"><span class="arrow-down--tw"></span>GME 3.05%</a></span> and <b>AMC Entertainment </b><span class="bztwnegative"><a class="ticker bztwwidgethover" href="https://benzinga.com/stock/amc#NYSE" id="bztwredarrow" title="AMC"><span class="arrow-down--tw"></span>AMC 2.75%</a></span>,  which helped RUT. So has strength in Financials, and more recently in  Health Care. All those sectors have relatively heavy weightings in the  RUT index. </p>
<p>Overseas, the European stock markets have been keeping close pace  with the SPX, up about 13% so far this year. In China, stocks continue  to struggle, up less than 3% year-to-date for the major Chinese index.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Timber! Lumber Getting Chopped: </b>Lumber futures fell  again Wednesday and are off about 45% from their 2021 peak. Lumber  prices are now below $900 per thousand board feet after spending months  above $1,000. A surge of new production at sawmills helps account for  the recent price weakness, and the high prices we saw the last few  months might have taken demand down a few notches. New home sales appear  to be getting “squeezed” by high costs for builders and high prices for  buyers, <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">Briefing.com</span> noted.</p>
<p>If you look farther out in the lumber futures market, <a href="https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/contango-backwardation-futures-markets-18174" rel="nofollow sponsored">prices for contracts in the months ahead are actually lower than the current contract, a situation called “backwardation</a>.”  This can mean the market anticipates continued weakness. Crude  currently trades the same way, with CME futures pointing toward prices  dropping into the high $60s per barrel by late this year and even lower  in 2022. Though that could definitely change, the futures market for  crude and lumber, two of the most volatile commodities of the year,  don’t appear to tell an inflationary story.</p>
