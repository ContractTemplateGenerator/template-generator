<p><span>Special  Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) have been all the rave in the  financial world over the past few months as they facilitate blockbuster  initial public offerings (IPOs) through mergers with startups just  before they go public. According to <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.spacresearch.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>SPAC Research</em></a>,  public offerings through special purpose companies raised more than $83  billion in 2020. By June 2021, SPAC-facilitated IPOs have already  raised more than $108 billion through the debut of close to 350 new  companies on the stock market. </span></p>

<div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:750px;"><span>Some of the famous names to go public through SPACs include DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ: </span><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/draftkings%20inc/1772757/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>DKNG</span></a><span>), ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: </span><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/chargepoint%20holdings%20inc/1777393/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>CHPT</span></a><span>), Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: </span><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/virgin%20galactic%20holdings%20inc/1706946/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>SPCE</span></a><span>), Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ: </span><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/nikola%20corp/1731289/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>NKLA</span></a><span>), and Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: </span><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/opendoor%20technologies%20inc/1801169/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>OPEN</span></a><span>).  DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ: DKNG), the Boston-based sports betting  company, has a market cap of close to $20 billion and an average trading  volume of 16,860,584. On May 12, investment advisory Goldman Sachs gave  the stock a Buy rating with a $77 price target.</span><span> </span><figcaption class="caption-collapse" style="max-width:750px;"></figcaption><figcaption class="caption-collapse" style="max-width:750px;"> ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CHPT), the California-based electric vehicle infrastructure company, raised close to $500 million in net proceeds from the SPAC-linked IPO earlier this year. The company has since reached a market valuation of over $10 billion and earned bullish ratings from investment advisors such as Jefferies and Needham. Jefferies has a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $40 while Needham also has a Buy rating on the shares with a slightly slower price target of $39. <br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span></figcaption><figcaption class="caption-collapse" style="max-width:750px;">Perhaps one of the most anticipated SPAC-facilitated IPOs of the past few months has been the stock market debut of Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPCE), the American spaceflight company that is one of the first big private spaceflight firms to go public, ahead of competitors like SpaceX and Blue Origin. The company went public last year at a valuation of over $2.3 billion and the share price of the firm had jumped by close to 45% till April. The firm now has a market cap of close to $9 billion. The stock is one of the most popular ones on Reddit forums.</p>
<p>As the clean energy business explodes around the world, firms like Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ: NKLA) have been going public. The company debuted on the stock exchange through a merger with a special purpose firm and was valued at over $12 billion. Known as the ‘Tesla of Trucking’, the firm recently announced that it had invested close to $50 million in a clean hydrogen project in Indiana. On May 28, investment advisory BTIG gave the stock a Buy rating with a price target of $18, calling it a disruptor in the truck market.</p>
<p>Another much-hyped IPO through a special purpose company over the past few months was the stock market debut of Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: OPEN), the California-based firm that runs a digital platform primarily focused on residential real estate across the United States. The company has a market cap of close to $10 billion and recently beat market expectations on earnings per share and revenue for the first quarter of 2021. The total homes sold on the platform in the first three months of 2021 stood at over 2,400.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how many more startups chose the SPAC path to go public this year. The technology sector, which has a natural aversion towards traditional finance, seems to be favoring this method more than other industries. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 197.2%, vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.
