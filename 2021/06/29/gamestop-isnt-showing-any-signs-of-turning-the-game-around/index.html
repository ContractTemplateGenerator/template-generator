<div style="text-align:center;"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="" class="i-amphtml-fill-content i-amphtml-replaced-content" height="427" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2012/gamestop-6286877_1920.jpg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1" width="640" /></div>
<p>So far, <b>GameStop </b>(NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GME#NYSE">GME</a>)  has been one of the top-performing stocks this year. On Friday, a list  released by the global index provides revealed it would join the FTSE  Russell 1000 Index of large-capitalization stocks while AMC  Entertainment Holdings Inc.(NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMC#NYSE">AMC</a>)   will remain in the Russell 2000 after both companies saw billions of  dollars added to their market values amid frenzied rallies since 2021  began. Shares of the meme stock skyrocketed in January. Sales rose 25%  in the fiscal first quarter as the company focuses on e-commerce and  tries to stage a turnaround under the helm of <b>Amazon.com </b>(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ">AMZN</a>) executive Matt Furlong.</p>
<p>The  gaming company declined to provide a forecast for the year. It only  revealed that sales momentum has continued into the second quarter. The  company&#8217;s first-quarter earnings report that was released earlier in  June highlighted its ongoing decline. It is no surprise considering that  software has always been the centerpiece of its business model, and  software sales have plunged by 46% over the past two years. <span></span></p>
<p><a name='more'></a></p>
<p>GameStop  did its best to paint its Q1 performance in the best possible light by  showing sales increased 25% YoY to$1.28 billion, despite a 12% reduction  in its store count and continued store closures in Europe. Adjusted net  loss shrank by more than 80% YoY to $29.4 million or $0.45 per share,  beating the average analyst estimate.</p>
<p>Yet  downward spiral was the elephant in the room two years ago, and the  retailer earned a small profit on $1.55 billion of revenue during the  same quarter. That performance was evaluated very poorly. If we look at  an even bigger picture, GameStop&#8217;s first-quarter revenue has plunged  nearly 30% over the past three years, and more importantly, the retailer  has swung from being solidly profitable to solidly unprofitable.</p>
<p>This year, GameStop is benefiting from the launch of the new <b>Sony Group Corporation</b> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SONY#NYSE">SONY</a>)-owned PlayStation and <b>Microsoft Corporation</b> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ">MSFT</a>)-owned  Xbox consoles, a tailwind that only occurs once every seven years or  so. Those console launches helped GameStop grow its sales of hardware  and accessories by 37% YoY last quarter.</p>
<p>By contrast, software  sales fell by nearly 5% from last year&#8217;s already-depressed level,  reaching $398 million. If we combine the last two years, GameStop&#8217;s  software sales have plunged by 46%. In other words, they are eroding,  and this will make it extremely difficult for the retailer to return to  profitability as these sales generated more than half of its gross  profit.</p>
<p>Less than 10% has been contributed by new hardware, which sells at notoriously thin margins.</p>
<p>It  shouldn&#8217;t be surprising that GameStop continues to lose share within  this shrinking market as consumer demand has steadily shifted toward  digital downloads in recent years. Meanwhile, higher-traffic retailers  are telling a different story. <b>Best Buy</b> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BBY#NYSE">BBY</a>)   recently reported that sales surged 36% YoY last quarter. Moreover,  the growth in its consumer electronics giant&#8217;s entertainment segment,  which includes gaming hardware, software, and accessories, has  significantly outpaced the retailer&#8217;s overall growth over the past two  years.</p>
<p><b>Staging A T</b><b>urnaround Is The Strategy Ahead</b></p>
<p>GameStop  hired two Amazon veterans as its new CEO and CFO as it embarks on a  turnaround strategy partially fueled by a Reddit-inspired stock rally.  However, new management and a new strategy cannot change the fundamental  realities threatening the business, such as software sales shifting to  digital downloads. Moreover, hardware sales will be even less profitable  in an e-commerce format, translating to higher credit card fees and  shipping costs for the struggling retailer.</p>
<p>On one side, the stock  rally allows GameStop to raise huge sums of cash by selling stock. This  will allow it to stay in business for a long time, even if it never  returns to profitability. But, under any scenario, both Amazon and Best  Buy are light years ahead of GameStop in e-commerce, and both have  massive resources at their disposal, all of which give GameStop little  chance of catching up. By its looks, the genuine turnaround for the  business (as opposed to the stock) seems far-fetched.</p>
