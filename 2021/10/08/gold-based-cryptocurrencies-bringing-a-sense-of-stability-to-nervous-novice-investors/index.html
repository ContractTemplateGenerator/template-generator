<p>Today’s new cryptocurrency investor is not the risk-taker of a few  years ago. They’ve seen the mistakes of the past 12 years in a volatile  investment market, and they’re becoming much more cautious. They’ve seen  people close to them dump money erratically into crypto because a  friend or family member thought it was a good idea. For many, it wasn’t.  Though more than 10% of Americans own some form of digital asset, many  made early mistakes diving in.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency has always been more  high risk than stock trading but not as risky as trading penny stocks  or options. New, more risk-averse investors are now looking into  cryptocurrency investment opportunities with solid backing.</p>
<p>Since  the infancy of the cryptocurrency trading market, developers have had an  interest in creating a gold-backed digital currency. To have that type  of digital currency means you link 1 token or coin to a specific  quantity of gold. The gold is then held in reserve, usually by a third  party. The significant advantage of having a gold-pegged digital  currency is that the baseline or minimum value of the token will always  be equal to the fixed amount of gold. The gold-backed digital currencies  offer protection against a considerable drop in value. So how do new  investors looking for more stable cryptocurrency investment  opportunities find an avenue to these gold-backed digital assets?</p>
<p>One company that has connected cryptocurrency and precious metal assets is <strong>Asia Broadband Inc</strong>. (OTC: <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AABB">AABB</a>),  which focuses on the production, supply, and sale of precious and base  metals. The company employs an innovative distribution process that has  led to the release of its <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://aabbgoldtoken.com/aabb-gold-token/?utm_source=benzinga&amp;utm_medium=sponsoredpost1&amp;utm_campaign=aabbg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AABB Gold (AABBG)</a> freshly minted mine-to-token gold-backed cryptocurrency and is  developing its proprietary digital exchange. AABB expects its token to  become a worldwide standard of exchange that is stable, secured, and  trusted with 100% physical gold. <span></span></p>

<p>Gold-backed tokens can benefit  from both gold and cryptocurrency features while maintaining the  potential for price appreciation from both markets. While AABBG is not a  stablecoin, it has the stability of a token price supported at 0.1  grams of the spot price of gold.</p>
<p>And while many novice investors steer towards better-known cryptocurrency exchanges such as <strong>Coinbase</strong> (NASDAQ: <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=COIN">COIN</a>), AABBG can be purchased using the easy-to-use <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://aabbgoldtoken.com?utm_source=benzinga&amp;utm_medium=sponsoredpost1&amp;utm_campaign=aabbg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AABB Wallet</a> app. Launched by the company in March 2021, the AABB Wallet is an  exceptionally unique entry-level opportunity for new investors and will  soon launch its proprietary cryptocurrency exchange within the wallet.  More than 14,000 investors have downloaded the AABB wallet, with the  size and scope of the Exchange project growing exponentially over the  past few months.</p>
<p>You can learn more about AABB Gold Token and the AABB Wallet at <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://aabbgoldtoken.com/aabb-gold-token/?utm_source=benzinga&amp;utm_medium=sponsoredpost1&amp;utm_campaign=aabbg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">www.aabbgoldtoken.com.</a></p>
