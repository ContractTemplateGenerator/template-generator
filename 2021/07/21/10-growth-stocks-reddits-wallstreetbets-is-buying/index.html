<p><span>Inflation fears and a dramatic drop in the prices of  cryptocurrencies over the past few weeks have hit growth stocks. Amid  uncertainty regarding federal policy on interest rates and non-fungible  tokens, investors are flocking to value offerings and gold as a hedge  against volatile bets. The shift represents a unique buying opportunity  in growth firms that are trading at lower prices than expected but have  plenty of room to climb higher. Investors are closely watching Reddit  forum WallStreetBets, which has become a vibrant community for stock  discussions and has a strong effect on broader market dynamics.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the firms presently popular on the forum include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: </span><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/amazon%20com%20inc/1018724/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>AMZN</span></a><span>), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: </span><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/tesla%20inc/1318605/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>TSLA</span></a><span>), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: </span><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/apple%20inc/320193/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>AAPL</span></a><span>), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: </span><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/nvidia%20corp/1045810/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>NVDA</span></a><span>),  among others. On July 19, growth stocks pushed the S&amp;P 500 and the  NASDAQ to new highs as US President Joe Biden held a meeting with  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and told the media afterwards that  inflation was only temporary and that the White House was taking all  steps necessary to support a post-pandemic economic recovery. </span></p>
<p><span>The fears around inflation had grown amid </span><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-times-michael-burry-market-182700564.html"><span>market crash predictions by investors like Michael Burry</span></a><span> and statistics released by the Labor Department that showed that consumer prices in the United States in June had </span><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-consumer-prices-surge-june-2021-07-13/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>increased</span></a><span> by most in thirteen years, with cars and trucks comprising more than  one-third of the surge in the Consumer Price Index amid a rebound in the  cost of travel-related services after a disappointing 2020. News agency  </span><i><span>Reuters</span></i> <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-says-inflation-temporary-fed-should-do-what-it-deems-necessary-recovery-2021-07-19/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>reports</span></a><span> that inflation concerns have also led to consumer sentiment in early July to touch five-month lows. <span></span></span></p>
<p><a name='more'></a></p>
<p><span>These  statistics, however, seem not to have affected the investment mindset  of retail investors who populate WallStreetBets. Growth stocks dominate  the list of most mentioned stocks on the forum. As retail investors  exert a growing influence on the overall market dynamics, investors can  gain important insight into growth offerings by monitoring Reddit  forums. These retail investors have transformed the world of finance by  coming out on top in a battle with hedge funds this year. It remains to  be seen whether they can sustain this victory.</span></p>
<p><span>The  entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing  financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last  decade, during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the  unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider  Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of  hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 ETFs by more than  124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February  26th 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 197.2%, vs.  72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than  124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to  identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that  significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and  sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13%  through November 16th. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an  extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

<p><span><em><strong>Our Methodology</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span>With this  context in mind, here is our list of the 10 growth stocks Reddit&#8217;s  WallStreetBets is buying. These stocks were ranked using hedge fund data  maintained by Insider Monkey. The ratings that market experts from  different investment advisory firms have assigned to these stocks were  also considered. In order to filter out meme stocks, the list has been  compiled using companies that have positive ratings, at least five or  more hedge funds with stakes, and at least double digit mentions on  Reddit over the past day. </span></p>

To  date, MicroStrategy has purchased over 90,000 bitcoins at an aggregate  purchase price of $2.17 bi11 ion and an average price of over $23,985  per bitcoin. Going forward, MicroStrategy plans to use excess cash  generated by its core business to purchase additional bitcoin.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span>bitcoin  relative to the U.S. dollar rose materially in the quarter. This  bitcoin appreciation was driven by concerns about U.S. dollar inflation  as well as other public companies deciding to acquire bitcoin to  diversify reserve assets. MicroStrategy is establishing itself as a  thought leader in the bitcoin space, and the company hosted an event at  its February user conference to help other organizations understand the  benefits of bitcoin as a reserve asset. MicroStrategy’s core software  business is also benefitting from its status as a leader in the bitcoin  space, with the increased public attention aiding MicroStrategy’s  recruitment and marketing efforts as the software business continues to  transition to a cloud-based subscription model.”</span></i></p>

<p><i><span>“One  of our investment themes over the last several years has been the  “humanization of pets,” which refers to the increasing amount of time  and money that people are devoting to their animals. This theme has  become even more evident during the pandemic, as many families and  individuals have adopted pets while spending more time at home. Today,  more than 85 million US households have pets. In 2015, roughly 7% of pet  products in the U.S. were bought online. By 2019, that number had  increased to 22%. Moreover, the pandemic has caused pet parents, new and  experienced alike, to sign up for delivery of pet supplies in order to  avoid trips to physical stores. 72% of pet owners made at least one  online purchase for their pets in the past 12 months and 39% of those  were subscription-based purchases.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Chewy (tkr: CHWY)  is the largest pure-play pet “e-tailer” in the world, offering “the  personalized service of a neighborhood pet store combined with the  convenience and speed of e-commerce.” The company was founded in 2011  and was bought by PetSmart in 2017, for $3 billion. In June, 2019, Chewy  went public. All of its sales are currently U.S.-based. The company has  co-headquarters with one facility in Dania Beach, Florida and one in  Boston, Massachusetts, and employs about 12,000 people. Chewy offers a  selection of high-quality pet food, treats, supplies, and pet healthcare  products.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>In addition to one-time sales, Chewy is  creating a recurring revenue model through its “autoship” program. This  is essentially a subscription service for products that are sent at  intervals specified by customers and includes such items as food and  medicine. Customers are more profitable the longer they stay with the  company, as their “lifetime value” grows. The company is organized  around providing an exceptional customer experience. Chewy has 10  fulfillment centers scattered across the US, which enable cost-efficient  overnight shipments to about 80% of the U.S. population and  cost-efficient two-day shipments to nearly 100%. This allows Chewy to  provide excellent service to the company’s more than 12.7 million active  users.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Chewy’s ability operate profitably in the  future hinges on two key variables: growing its customer base and more  efficiently managing its fulfillment costs through automation of its  fulfillment centers, thereby decreasing labor costs. Chewy has a smart,  experienced management team and the company is expected to become  profitable at the end of this fiscal year.”</span></i></p>

These new, higher-margin products  have helped the company partially close its margin gap with peers and  capture share from market leader Intel. While we believe there is  meaningful runway for further share gains and margin expansion, AMD has  appreciated far beyond our mid-cap market cap mandate, and we exited our  position.”</span></i></p>
