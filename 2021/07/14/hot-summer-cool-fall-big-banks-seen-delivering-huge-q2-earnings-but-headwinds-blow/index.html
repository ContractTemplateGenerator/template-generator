<p></p>
<p>After riding swift tailwinds through Q1, the biggest U.S. banks could face tougher times as Q2 earnings loom.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean Q2 year-over-year earnings growth for the Financial  sector won’t be immense. Remember, at this time a year ago, the  industry was struggling through the worst of the Covid shutdowns. With  comparisons on the easy side, analysts project an amazing 117% earnings  per share growth for Financials in Q2, according to research firm  FactSet. That’s the third-highest projection FactSet has on a sector  basis.</p>
<p>This comes after the Financial sector posted 34.5% earnings growth in  Q1, a banner quarter for the big banks thanks in part to blistering  performance in their trading and investment banking businesses.</p>
<p>The concern as Q2 earnings season approaches is that earnings might  be peaking as trading activity slows and interest rates remain  stubbornly low. A decline in <a href="https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/investing/spacs-life-cycle-after-acquisition-18655">“special purpose acquisition companies” (SPACs)</a> activity during Q2 might also have hurt the sector.</p>
<p>In one sign of changing times, <strong>JP Morgan Chase</strong> <span class="bztwnegative"><a class="ticker bztwwidgethover" href="https://benzinga.com/stock/jpm#NYSE" id="bztwredarrow" title="JPM"><span class="arrow-down--tw"></span>JPM 1.43%</a></span> CEO Jamie Dimon said last month the bank now expects $52.5 billion in  net interest income in 2021, down from the $55 billion it anticipated in  February, as the firm stockpiled cash and on lower credit card  balances.</p>
<p>The big banks don’t typically get too granular on guidance, so the  important thing for investors is to listen closely to what their  executives say on their earnings calls about the economic environment  and where they see it heading in coming months. <span></span></p>

As they get ready to report, they face a very different environment than just three months ago.</p>
<p>At that point, the rate picture looked far more friendly for banks.  The key 10-year yield had soared from under 1% at the start of the year  to above 1.75% by late March, giving banks a nice boost. Remember,  one-way banks profit is by borrowing money at lower rates and lending it  out at higher rates. A yield curve that had been gaining steam since  the worst days of the pandemic gave banks a boost, but now it’s  narrowed.</p>
<p>As yields basically marched in place over the course of Q2 and the  Fed kept up its mantra that recent inflation is “transitory,” Wall  Street trading activity in fixed income—another big profit source for  banks—died down quite a bit. Yields entered the range-bound territory  and pretty much stayed there from early May right on through to the end  of June. By July, the 10-year was back under 1.4%. That doesn’t exactly  indicate booming times for banks’ trading businesses, most of which saw a  major benefit from Covid-associated volatility until recently.</p>
<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Lackluster_Trading_In_Q2_Could_Weigh"></span>Lackluster Trading In Q2 Could Weigh<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>Even the stock market mostly went into a holding pattern during Q2,  with major indices grinding slowly higher to new records but very few  days of 1% gains or losses. In fact, trading was about as dull and  uninspired as we’ve seen since the dog days of 2018, and the <strong>Cboe Volatility Index</strong> (VIX) fell to post-pandemic lows by June.</p>
<p>As always, investors should consider focusing on the separate  fortunes of equities and fixed income trading, where there’s often  bifurcation. </p>
<p>In one positive development, the sizzling housing market and  continued strength in U.S. manufacturing mean more households and  businesses might have been out there borrowing last quarter, a potential  boost for banks. This could go especially for big banks with major  consumer-facing businesses like credit cards and home mortgages. </p>
<p>Most of the major banks put large amounts of capital into “loan loss  provisions” over the last year as a shield in case of default from  clients, but began pulling those back pretty significantly as 2021  progressed. These protective measures weighed on earnings in 2020 but  may be less of a factor in the coming months. One interesting thing to  look for as banks report is what they say about rolling back more of  this caution because it could potentially flow back into the bottom  line.</p>
<p>In addition, one of the measures banks took to protect themselves in  the down years, including cost-cutting and higher fees, aren’t going  away and could continue to provide traction. Also, the big banks last  month passed the Fed’s “stress test” with flying colors, allowing many  of them to raise dividends and potentially buy back shares. </p>
<p>Despite those worries, Financials are the second best-performing  sector year-to-date, up more than 25% through early July. Only Energy  (another downtrodden sector until recently) gained more ground since  Jan. 1.</p>
<p>We’ll examine MS, BAC, and C in a subsequent preview, but for now  let’s focus on the first big banks to report, led by JPM and GS on  Tuesday followed by WFC on Wednesday. </p>

<p><strong>FIGURE 1: LOSING GROUND. </strong>After tracking well ahead of the <strong>S&amp;P 500 Index</strong> (SPX—purple line) for much of 2021, <strong>JP Morgan</strong> (JPM—candlestick),  the biggest U.S. Financial stock by market capitalization, has had a  tough month and is now well under the pace being set recently by the  SPX.

<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="JP_Morgan_Chase_Holding_Onto_Cash_Anticipating_Inflation"></span>JP Morgan Chase Holding Onto Cash, Anticipating Inflation<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>JPM shares remained solid in Q2 despite recent worries about falling  rates and soft fixed-income trading. The bank is considered an industry  leader thanks to what it calls its “fortress” balance sheet, and as the  U.S. bank with the most assets. Also, CEO Dimon tends to be influential,  with the market sometimes moving on his words in the company’s earnings  calls.</p>
<p>Last time out, JPM demolished analysts’ earnings Q1 projections, with  revenue coming in well above Wall Street’s estimates thanks in part to  strength in the company’s trading operations. JPM also got a $5.2  billion benefit from releasing money it had previously set aside for  loan losses that didn’t develop.</p>
<p>Neither of those tailwinds can necessarily be counted on this time  around, considering the condition of fixed income trading in Q2 and the  fact that JPM and many big banks have already dialed back those  Covid-related loan reserves. The loan reserve drawdown has been an  accelerant for bank earnings the last two quarters, but the question is  how many times can you milk the same cow?</p>
<p>On the earnings call, Dimon is likely to face questions that go well  beyond JPM’s own books and into the state of the economy. It will be  interesting to get his take on the Fed’s most recent minutes released  last week, especially since he said in June he expressed doubts about  the Fed’s repeated claim of inflation being “transitory.”</p>
<p>“We have a lot of cash and capability and we’re going to be very  patient because I think you have a very good chance inflation will be  more than transitory,” Dimon said last month, according to media  reports. </p>
<p>The question might be, what does the company believe is worth  investing in and what will the rate picture have to be for it to use  some of the $500 billion in cash Dimon says the bank is “stockpiling.”</p>
<p>Also, remember that if some of JPM’s potential earnings come from  releasing loan loss reserve money, that’s not likely to be a recurring  source of profit. In fact, last time out Dimon said he didn’t consider  that part of earnings to be a true reflection of the bank’s bottom line.  Investors should probably look at it the same way, both for JPM and  other big banks.</p>
<p>The credit card issue Dimon referred to could be a challenge for JPM  and other banks.  Some industry followers say they’ve seen higher rates  of people paying off their credit card balances, which of course could  mean lower interest income for the processors. Also, government checks  appeared to swell many peoples’ savings accounts, which may mean less  need to use credit to buy smaller-ticket items, research firm <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">Briefing.com</span> observed.</p>
<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="SPACs_Dwindled_but_IPOs_In_Focus_As_Goldman_Sachs_Reports"></span>SPACs Dwindled but IPOs In Focus As Goldman Sachs Reports<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs is the big bank that gets the largest chunk of its  revenue from Wall Street trading and activity. That means the softer  trading environment of Q2 might have dragged its business. Remember that  in Q1, GS trounced analysts’ expectations. The trading business hummed  along and investment banking—another huge area for GS—delivered strong  returns.</p>
<p>In Q2, slower trading activity and a decline in SPAC activity may  weigh, even though year-over-year results are expected to be strong. </p>
<p>Way back in January during the GS Q4 earnings call, GS CEO David  Solomon warned that the boom in equity issuance by SPACs isn’t  sustainable.</p>
<p>“There will be something that will in some way, shape or form bring  the activity levels down over a period of time,” Solomon said. “Like  many innovations, there is a point in time as they start where they have  a tendency maybe to go a little bit too far and they need to be pulled  back or rebalanced in some way.” </p>
<p>Recent regulatory warnings have raised questions around the  accounting and revenue projections for many SPACs. Additionally, SPACs’  rapid growth spurred exchanges to begin exploring ways to cut red tape  and streamline the initial public offering (IPO) process. </p>
<p>“There’s no question that enthusiasm for SPACs has waned since the  peak of exuberance in mid-February,” SPAC Research stated in a report  earlier in Q2. “The market has softened, and investors are no longer  scooping up anything they can find just because it has the word ‘SPAC’  attached.”</p>
<p>The regulatory concerns helped send SPAC stocks down sharply. New  SPAC issuance dwindled to 20 deals from April through mid-May, compared  to nearly 300 during the Q1, according to SPACInsider. None of this is  particularly great news for GS or other big banks hoping to capitalize  on the trend, but it could mean they get more aggressive pursuing the  IPO business.</p>
<p>One thing GS can perhaps shed light on its earnings call is the  future of the mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) and initial public  offerings (IPO) markets. Some of the “SPAC mania” has died down but  you’re starting to see a strong pickup in IPO activity and hearing  reports of a likelihood of M&amp;A activity which could be a nice  second-half benefit, <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">Briefing.com</span> said.</p>
<p>Usually a market featuring plenty of IPO and M&amp;A activity means  healthy times for big investment banks, and GS has a huge exposure here.  Tech has been a leader in IPOs so far this year, and that could  continue if you look at some of the companies planning to go public  later in 2021. Biotech also has been jumping on the IPO bandwagon. There  was a flurry of activity in biotech IPOs recently. Of the 16 companies  that listed their shares one week in mid-June, 10 were in the biotech  space or provide tools to biotechs, Barron’s noted. </p>
<p>In Q1, GS reported strength in its Investment Banking and Global  Markets businesses, with underwriting providing a big chunk of the  Investment Banking growth. Financial advising also grew nicely. Those  are areas to watch for potential continued strength when GS reports Q2  results. </p>
<p>Also look for the company to potentially use the earnings call to  provide updates on its plans to grow wealth management and consumer  banking.</p>
<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="WFC_Worth_Checking_For_Mortgage_Market_Update"></span>WFC Worth Checking For Mortgage Market Update<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>One big bank on Wall Street that’s had some issues lately is Wells  Fargo. The “fake account scandal” from a few years ago continues to be a  drag for the company, but its shares spiked when WFC reported stronger  than expected Q1 earnings.</p>
<p>To be fair, some of the strength came from WFC releasing reserves it  had set aside for possible protection against Covid-related defaults.  That’s not necessarily in the realm of “organic” growth. Still, WFC  raised some optimism last time out when it said it hoped for a recovery  in the commercial side of its business as the economy improved.</p>
<p>The company is the biggest mortgage lender in the U.S., and the  sizzling housing market continued for much of Q2, though it’s leveled  off a bit over the last month.</p>
<p>One concern for WFC is the recent drop in interest rates, which might  be threatening its margins. Still, shares have had a nice run recently,  up more than 15% since the end of Q1.</p></p>
