<p>A pandemic, mismatches between the supply and demand of goods, and  disruptions to the global supply chain have all been called on as  reasons for the current influx of <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-inflation" target="_blank">inflation</a> rates.</p>
<p>“The world is just beginning to emerge from an unprecedented shock to  financial markets and our personal lives,” says Steven Saunders,  director and portfolio advisor with Round Table Wealth Management in  Westfield, New Jersey.</p>
<p>As a result, inflation rates have risen, and the higher prices today reflect that trend.</p>
<p>Now after months of uncertainty, the question remains, “What’s  ahead?” When it comes to inflation rates and investments, the dilemma  can be worrisome, especially for those looking for ways to build wealth  over the long-term.</p>
<p>Before making financial decisions, it can be helpful to understand  the relationship between inflation and different types of investments.  Consider the following ways that inflation can impact properties, bonds,  stocks, and precious metals as you evaluate your portfolio and its  performance.</p>

<p>“During high inflation, we tend to see rent increase,” says Juan  Marin, a real estate broker and investor at IBR Group Corp in Orlando,  Florida. As interest rates rise as well, it can be difficult for those  renting to get a mortgage and move into their own home. As such, many  renters may opt to stay where they are and pay a higher price from month  to month. Given these trends, if you own rental property, such as  residential, commercial, multi-unit, or single-family homes, you may see  higher than normal demand and returns as a result of high inflation.</p>
<p>Another area that might bring higher returns involves real estate  investment trusts (REITs), which are companies that own or finance real  estate properties. They invest in a variety of property segments and  typically focus on income-generating properties. “REITs will follow the  market demands and appreciation similar to that of physical real  estate,” Marin says. As such, REITs may provide a way to distribute your  investment across numerous assets.</p>
<p>However, other forms of real estate investing, like vacation rentals,  might not perform as well. “When prices rise and pockets get tight,  travel tends to be reduced from the yearly budget,” Marin says.</p>

<p>“Currently, a portfolio of just Treasury bonds and cash does not  provide the required return to compensate for inflation,” Saunders says.  The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, the dollars you have today  will lose value over time. If you have $100 cash and the inflation rate  is 5 percent, that $100 will be able to purchase $95 worth of goods and  services after a year. As this trend continues, the money’s purchasing  power will continue to decline. Second, bonds with fixed returns that  are lower than inflation rates could put you at a loss. The return you  receive may be less than the rate by which goods and services are  increasing.</p>
<p>“Investors may be quick to buy TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected  Securities) if they fear inflation is going to increase,” Saunders says.  As the name suggests, these investment vehicles are adjusted for  inflation. That said, the adjusted portion is only part of the return.  The other portion is called “real yield,” which is the yield on a  nominal treasury bond minus the expected inflation. “TIPS outperform  nominal bonds when the real yield is declining, meaning inflation  expectations are increasing faster than nominal rates in a rate rising  environment,” Saunders says. “However, if nominal yields increase at a  faster pace than inflation expectations, a TIPS investor can actually  lose money as real yields rise.”</p>

<p>The S&amp;P 500, which began in 1920s, has averaged around a 10  percent return. “Since the average U.S. inflation rate is around 2.25  percent, you can see how putting your money in the market should earn  you more than the annual average,” says Joseph Gissy, founder and CEO of  Strategy Marketplace in Mundelein, Illinois. “However, an average  doesn’t always work in all cases.”</p>
<p>For instance, “we could end up in a period where the S&amp;P 500 hits  a period of a bear market because when inflation is typically high,  then the markets can tumble,” Gissy says. If that happens, the S&amp;P  could stumble and have trouble providing a return that keeps up with  inflation. Some stocks might perform better than others during periods  of inflation, as many factors weigh into a company’s current and  forecasted performance. As such, investing in stocks during periods of  inflation may need additional research and call for decisions to be made  on an individual basis.</p>

<p>“If you’re looking to outpace inflation rates, it could be worth  investing a portion of your savings in precious metals like gold or  silver,” says Maxim Manturov, head of investment research at Freedom  Finance Europe. You might also consider precious metals exchanged-traded  funds (ETFs), which consist of various securities that are bundled and  traded together on a stock exchange like a regular stock.</p>
<p>“Assets like precious metals are great safe havens for your finances  because their value generally appreciates to account for  inflation—making it a relatively safe way of avoiding depreciation on  the savings that you’re making,” Manturov says.</p>
