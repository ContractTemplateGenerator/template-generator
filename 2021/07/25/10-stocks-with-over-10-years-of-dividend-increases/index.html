<p style="text-align:justify;">While some investors may prefer  investing in bonds instead of stocks, particularly during times of  market volatility and financial instability, the importance of  dividend-paying stocks can never be understated. According to <a class="external" href="https://avemariafunds.com/pdfs/smart-investing/AMMF%20importance-of-dividends.pdf?v=1Q2021" rel="nofollow">Ave Maria Funds</a>,  for instance, between 1970 to 2021, the S&amp;P 500’s growth of $1,000  with dividends was a total of $193,630, of which $150,441 was  contributed solely by dividends. As for the question of their  performance in times of economic volatility,<a class="external" href="https://www.globalxetfs.com/content/files/High-Dividend-Stocks-In-Rising-Interest-Rate-Environments.pdf" rel="nofollow"> Global X Management Company LLC</a> has estimated that since 1960, during the 10 time periods of increasing  interest rates, dividend stocks, and particularly high-yielding  dividend stocks, were able to outperform the market by an annualized  average of 0.80%.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the above in  mind, investing in dividend stocks has managed to remain a prevalent  practice with many investors gravitating towards dividend-yielders  because of their attractive returns and the possibility of setting up a  reliable income stream to get them through times of financial distress.  Moreover, the fact that dividends were responsible for generating about <a class="external" href="https://www.fa-mag.com/userfiles/ads_2019/SPDJI_Oct_2019/research-sp500-dividend-aristocrats.pdf" rel="nofollow">a third</a> of the total return for the S&amp;P 500 since 1926 means that having a  sustainable income from dividends is an important consideration for  total return expectations. As such, dividend stocks with attractive  yields and reliable payout histories like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:  <a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/microsoft%20corp/789019/">MSFT</a>), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: <a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/mastercard%20inc/1141391/">MA</a>), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE: <a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/unitedhealth%20group%20inc/731766/">UNH</a>), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE: <a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/merck%20%26%20co%20inc/310158/">MRK</a>) can be considered good investment options in financially difficult circumstances.<span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Investing  is becoming difficult by the day, even for the smart money. The entire  hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing  financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last  decade, during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the  unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider  Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of  hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 ETFs by more than  124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February  26th 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 197.2%, vs.  72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than  124 percentage points (<a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/monthly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>see the details here</strong></a>).  We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund  holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been  tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and  they lost 13% through November 16th. That’s why we believe hedge fund  sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay  attention to.

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Within  IT, we have also increased exposure to a cyclical semiconductor  industry currently working through a severe supply shortage due to  several years of capacity reductions, COVID-19 shutdowns and one-off  production delays as well as demand resilience in areas like autos and  smartphones. The main risk for semiconductors is short-term revenue  pressure until capacity catches up with demand, which hurt wireless  chipmaker <strong>Qualcomm</strong>. Looking past current constraints, we expect the industry to see a strong second half and solid growth in 2022.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In Q1, we initiated a position in <strong>Merck</strong>,  a provider of health care solutions including prescription medicines,  vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health and consumer care products.  We purchased Merck when the stock came under pressure in part on  concerns that the newly minted Biden administration could implement  regulatory changes and lower drug costs in the pharmaceutical industry.  Recent, but anticipated changes to Merck’s management team have also  weighed on shares, as have concerns over the company’s heavy reliance on  immunotherapy treatment Keytruda. Notably, Merck is not getting much  credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical  development, despite having several solid and large new product  opportunities. Additionally, the company’s strong balance sheet and  robust free cash flow provide it multiple options for future  partnerships and acquisitions. While Merck is undergoing a period of  transition, we think the company’s fundamentals are strong and believe  changes to management should be a catalyst for improvement.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We funded the shift primarily with trims in <strong>Comcast</strong> following  big gains in this name. Comcast is a long-term holding that have been  and remain core holdings. During the quarter, however, we took gains and  resized the positions to reflect their current risk-reward post strong  increases in the stocks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Comcast,  like Blackstone, has been a meaningful long-term holding whose stock  performance has at times lagged its robust fundamental performance. Over  the last nine months the stock price caught up some with the  fundamentals and looked like it had more room to run. Our thesis on the  name evolved, however, following the May 17 announcement that competitor  Discovery was merging its operations with Time Warner. This deal  positions the new company as a credible competitor to Netflix, Amazon  Prime, Hulu and Disney, and results in Comcast being left without the  proverbial dance partner in the evolving pay TV/DTC landscape. While we  continue to believe Comcast’s cable systems business is well-positioned  and that NBCUniversal remains valuable, the competitive dynamic for  NBCUniversal has stiffened. Our reduced position size reflects both our  continued enthusiasm for many parts of the franchise and emerging  concerns given the evolving pay TV/DTC landscape.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A  good way to conceptualize how we think about portfolio construction is  to picture a pyramid. At the bottom of the pyramid are the durable  compounding growth companies that form the strong foundation, resilience  and consistency for the Strategy. We think these companies should  comprise just under half of portfolio assets and feature annual revenue  growth rates ranging from two times GDP up to 20% as well as healthy  free cash flow generation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>UnitedHealth Group</strong>,  a name we have owned in the Strategy since 1992, is a good example of a  long-term compounder, having grown its revenue base from approximately  $600 million to north of $260 billion over that time frame. It remains  constantly focused on investing in new growth drivers such as  telemedicine and health care analytics. Broadcom and Comcast have  delivered similar long-term appreciation through a combination of  organic growth, capital deployment into new and adjacent opportunities  through merger and acquisition activity as well as returning capital to  shareholders through buybacks and dividends.”</p>
