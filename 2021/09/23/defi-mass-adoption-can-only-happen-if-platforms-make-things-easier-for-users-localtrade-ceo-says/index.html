<p><em>Legacy  mechanisms in the traditional financial system have proven outdated and  incapable of adjusting to current consumer needs. Based on the bitcoin  principles of P2P relationships and a secure underlying blockchain  technology, DeFi pioneers -like LocalTrade-, have envisioned a  revolution in the financial system where all services are offered  low-cost, fairly and securely without any middlemen.</em></p>
<p>DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, promises to bring about a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> fully decentralized financial system</a>.  In this scenario, transactions will be made through P2P relationships  between users, without having to be authorized by banks or a central  authority. This means that consumers can seamlessly access traditional  financial services like loans and trading, which are offered by other  users or companies through decentralized, blockchain-powered  applications. </p>
<p>From a user standpoint, this just makes sense as a  natural evolution of a financial system dragged down by legacy  technology, mechanisms and key players that haven’t been able to  accordingly adjust to their needs.<span></span></p>

<p>As Peter Wall, CEO of global crypto mining company Argo Blockchain, said to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertfarrington/2021/03/23/explaining-defi-and-how-it-will-revolutionize-financial-services/?sh=2294a6301d08" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> Forbes</a>:  “The need for an accessible, transparent, and secure system has become  increasingly apparent, with centralized entities and banks continuing to  fail communities seeking trustworthy financial freedom. In theory,  decentralized finance can offer improved transparency and more robust  security while replacing many of the current outdated processes which  can lead to a truly decentralized and democratized financial ecosystem.”</p>

<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_Rise_of_DeFi_Apps_The_Case_of_LocalTrade"></span><strong>The Rise of DeFi Apps: The Case of LocalTrade</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>DeFi  is an umbrella term, a series of interconnected technologies, ideas,  and platforms in which users operate in a decentralized manner. In the  same way that Uber enables self-employed drivers to get in touch with  their riders, DeFi platforms establish the fundamental technology and  services for their users to exploit.</p>
<p>A good example of how a DeFi platform works can be found on LocalTrade. <a href="https://localtrade.cc/" rel="dofollow" target="_blank"> LocalTrade</a> is a widely recognized platform for trading cryptocurrencies — in  exchange for other crypto or fiat currencies. Their history is tied with  that of crypto, evolving alongside them and trying to stay ahead of the  curve. They initially started as a crypto exchange, but they have  steadily redoubled their efforts to become a key player in the  burgeoning DeFi space.</p>
<p>That’s why they are building a complete  finance ecosystem where they offer different services. They are hard at  work to upgrade their initial exchange offerings to become a DEX  (Decentralized Exchange), greatly improving the number of trading pairs  to help further develop the space. Alongside that, they have introduced a  decentralized multi-currency wallet; they have kickstarted the  LocalTrade LaunchPad, a platform for launching cryptocurrency projects  within their platform and are in the late stages of launching a yield  farming protocol — the smart-contract which allows to route funds to  various DeFi projects in order to receive rewards liquidity mining  rewards.</p>
<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Closing_the_gap_between_DeFi_and_the_old_system_The_costly_user_entry_point"></span><strong>Closing the gap between DeFi and the old system: The costly user entry point</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>One  of the challenges that DeFi faces as a whole is the costly entry point  for new users. Crypto is still unknown territory for many users driven  by mixed messages from authorities, regulatory bodies and mass media.</p>
<p>“One  of the main reasons why the wide public doesn’t recognize DeFi as an  investment destination lies in an extremely complicated user journey. It  takes a lot of technical knowledge and background in crypto to simply  enter the sphere, and it takes even more to understand the intricacies  and potential opportunities of decentralized finance. We address this  issue by removing complexity from the equation and condensing the best  DeFi opportunities in a unified, easy-to-use and secure product,”  recently <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/how-a-crypto-exchange-platform-is-going-global-the-rise-of-localtrade-2591587" rel="dofollow" target="_blank">said</a> LocalTrade CEO Aaron Yahalom.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s  hard to say when DeFi will go mainstream. Much of it depends on who  finds it useful and why. Many DeFi projects are still too complex for  beginners to understand. Stablecoins, one of the basic DeFi offerings,  aren&#8217;t as secure and reliable as they promised to be; and understanding  the concept of money legos or yield harvesting is a whole different  level.</p>
<p>However,  that’s only a small part of what DeFi is set out to be. DeFi is about  providing financial services we all know in a simpler, more transparent,  and fairer way. Services for all levels of investors that range from  everyday banking, insurance, loans and mortgages, to complicated  contractual relationships and asset trading. </p>
<p>That means that DeFi  is also about updating traditional financial transactions: anything  from payments, trading securities and insurance, to lending and  borrowing is already happening in DeFi. It is also about giving users  the freedom to operate in this space easily through their private crypto  wallets. And through these wallets, they can operate independently from  the largest cryptocurrency exchanges and give investors access to  everything: from cryptocurrency to investing in DApps, such as  blockchain-based games. It is about lending through smart contracts,  investing in the right products through reliable data, and much more.</p>
<p>That’s  exactly what LocalTrade wants to achieve. They strongly believe that by  providing a technologically updated, user-friendly platform with extra  security, they will be able to attract all users to the promising DeFi  sphere. well as.</p>
<p>“There is a costly entry point for newcomers and  beginner investors into the DeFi space right now. Complicated UX/UI,  lack of trust and transparency and highly complex financial products are  barriers that hold crypto and blockchain into going mainstream. At  LocalTrade, our most immediate concern is actually closing those gaps by  providing advanced functionality for traders, stellar customer service,  greater transparency, and speedy withdrawals and deposits. We aim to  promote a new vision of financial services by combining the transparency  and high-yield potential of the DeFi sector with  AML-compliance and  convenient fiat gateways of centralized exchanges. We believe that DeFi  mass adoption can only happen if platforms make things easier for  users,”  LocalTrade CEO Aaron Yahalom said.</p>
<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Decentralization_powered_by_blockchain_and_crypto"></span><strong>Decentralization powered by blockchain and crypto</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>This  Decentralized Finance is based on the principles of Bitcoin and  Ethereum and securely powered by blockchain technology. In fact, the  underlying principles of crypto and blockchain are the enablers of  decentralization in finance.</p>
<p>In the current centralized financial  system, all transactions — including user activities — are stored in a  private ledger, owned and managed by a large financial institution.  These only share that information with bigger authorities, if required  to, fostering opacity and exclusivity. </p>
<p>On the other hand, in a  DeFi system, all transactions are recorded in the blockchain, which in  essence is a distributed public ledger. This means all parties using a  DeFi application have an identical copy of the public ledger, which  records each and every transaction in encrypted code. That secures the  system by providing users with anonymity, plus verification of payments  and a record of asset ownership that’s (nearly) impossible to alter by  fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>“The goal of DeFi is to reconstruct the banking system for the whole world in this open, permissionless way,” says <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2019/04/26/why-everyone-in-crypto-is-talking-about-defi/?sh=36942e9c723f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> Alex Pack</a>, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital, a $100 million crypto fund, for Forbes.</p>
