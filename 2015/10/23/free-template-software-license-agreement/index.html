<p>This is a more or less standard Software License Agreement that is drafted to protect the licensor and its program. This particular template is adjusted for a SaaS license deal but it can be easily tweaked for mobile apps and pretty much any other piece of licensed code.</p>
<p>Here it is in a <a href="http://thecorporateattorneys.com/Free%20Templates/Software%20License%20Agreement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF format</a>.</p>
<p>Key aspects:</p>
<p>1. <i><b>It’s a license, not a sale. </b></i>Subscriber doesn’t get any ownership rights to the program.</p>
<p>2. <i><b>Subscriber retains all ownership and IP rights to Subscriber’s data. Company retains all rights to the Company program</b></i>.</p>
<p>3. Subscriber may not modify or reverse engineer the program.</p>
<p>4. Software is provided <i><b>without any warranties, “as is.” Company’s maximum liability shall in no event exceed, in the aggregate, the total amounts actually paid to Company in the last 12 months</b></i>.</p>
<p>5. Company may use Subscriber’s name/logo in marketing materials and press releases.</p>
<p>6. Indemnification, Confidentiality, Severability.</p>
