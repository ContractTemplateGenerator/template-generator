<p>California has seized an opportunity to show that it takes its residents&#8217; privacy serious, just a couple of days after the <a href="http://blog.thecorporateattorneys.com/2015/10/eus-highest-court-invalidates-eu-us.html" target="_blank">Court of Justice of the European Union had declared US digital privacy laws inadequate</a>.</p>
<p>Today, CA Gov. Jerry Brown has signed <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB178" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">S.B. 178</a>, the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (CalECPA). CalECPA requires law enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant before accessing digital records, including emails and texts, as well as GPS data. These protections apply to electronic devices and online services that store user data.</p>
<p>The law requires a search warrant for electronic information to describe with particularity the information to be seized.</p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies may request the digital information without a warrant in emergency situations but then they have three days after obtaining the information to file for a warrant.</p>
<p>Only Maine and Utah currently have similar laws.</p>
<p>The bill has been supported by Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter and a number of other major tech companies. CalECPA is co-sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union of California, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the California Newspaper Publishers Association.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aclunc.org/news/landmark-victory-digital-privacy-gov-brown-signs-california-electronic-communications-privacy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ACLU reports</a> that last year, AT&amp;T received 64,000 requests for production of digital information and Verizon reports that only one-third of requests had a warrant. Twitter and Tumblr received more demands from California than any other state.</p>
