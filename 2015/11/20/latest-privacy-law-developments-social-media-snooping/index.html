<p>Lately, we&#8217;ve been witnessing some quite positive developments in privacy law of the US. Some of them are foreign-influenced: the <a href="http://blog.thecorporateattorneys.com/2015/10/eus-highest-court-invalidates-eu-us.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Court of Justice of the European Union has declared US digital privacy laws inadequate</a> last month. Some efforts come from beloved California <a href="http://blog.thecorporateattorneys.com/2015/10/california-police-must-now-get-warrants.html" target="_blank">where the police must now get warrants before requesting online data</a>, starting Oct 8, 2015. Many other states are following in the right direction, too, which brings us to</p>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><b>MASSACHUSETTS</b></div>
<p>On Wednesday, MA Senators voted, 39-0, on <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/189/Senate/S2034/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">S.2034 &#8211; An Act Relative to Social Media Privacy Protection</a>. If enacted, <b><i><u>the bill would prohibit educational institutions and employers to request a user name, password or other means for access to a personal social media account. </u></i></b>The bill also prohibits compelling a student or employee to add anybody as a “friend,” including but not limited to, a coach, teacher, other school employee or school volunteer, or any agent of the employer.</p>
<p>An aggrieved student may institute a civil action for damages or to restrain a violation of the Act and may recover <b><i>$1,000 for each violation.</i></b></p>
<p>The bill does not apply to information that has been publicly shared by a student or employee. The bill does not limit an educational institution’s or employer’s right to promulgate and maintain lawful policies governing the use of the educational institution’s electronic equipment, including policies regarding use of the internet, email or social media.</p>
<p>The bill includes exemptions for employers to deal with investigations related to social network accounts. However, an employer, prior to requesting access to a personal social media account, shall notify the employee of the grounds for the request; and provided further, that (i) any access to an employee’s personal social media account shall be limited to identifying relevant evidence, (ii) the social media is used solely for purposes of the investigation or a related proceeding, and (iii) the employer has no other means of obtaining the relevant information.</p>
<p>MA State Senators are currently considering amendments to the bill that would cover interns and prevent employers and schools from requesting printed copies of social media account contents. After that, the bill will go to the House for a round of votes.</p>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><b>OTHER STATES</b></div>
<p>In 2012, state legislators began introducing privacy bills to prevent employers and schools from requesting passwords to personal Internet accounts.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/-giLJtNX5Xxw/Vk67gscRubI/AAAAAAAAErs/RdlWJkvqq2Y/s1600/riley-stratton.jpg" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" border="0" height="320" src="https://i0.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/-giLJtNX5Xxw/Vk67gscRubI/AAAAAAAAErs/RdlWJkvqq2Y/s320/riley-stratton.jpg?resize=320%2C320" width="320" /></a>A number of lawsuits challenged the legality of employers and schools demanding passwords. For example, in 2014, Riley Stratton (<i>photo: Associated Press</i>), a Minnesota sixth-grader, represented by ACLU, achieved a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/teenager-wins-70000-settlement-after-school-viewed-her-facebook-profile-2014-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$70,000 settlement after her school accessed her Facebook profile </a>and emails to look into the disparaging comments about a teacher&#8217;s aide she had left from her home computer.</p>
<p><i><b>In 2015, <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/employer-access-to-social-media-passwords-2013.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">at least 23 states have considered the legislation and nine states have enacted it</a> this year.</b></i></p>
<p>The National Conference of State Legislatures maintains<a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/state-laws-prohibiting-access-to-social-media-usernames-and-passwords.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> a list of state statutes related to social media privacy at work and in schools</a>.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><b>CALIFORNIA LAW</b></div>
<p>California has already enacted similar laws. The relevant excerpts are below.</p>
<p><b><i>Education Code </i></b><br /><b><i>Section 99120-99122 </i></b></p>
