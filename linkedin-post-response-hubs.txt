Just shipped two new legal resource hubs—free, comprehensive defense guides for businesses facing pre-litigation threats.

TCPA Response Hub
terms.law/Demand-Letters/respond/telemarketing-tcpa/

11 specialized guides for robocall and robotext claims:

- Exposure Calculator — input your volume and get realistic damage ranges
- Consent Evidence Checklist — audit your opt-in documentation
- Settlement Playbook — pre-litigation negotiation templates
- California Overlay — Cal. Civ. Code § 1770 and enhanced penalties
- Vendor Liability — when your SMS provider or lead gen creates exposure
- DNC/Opt-Out Violations — internal list compliance
- Compliance Remediation — stop ongoing liability before settlement

The math on TCPA is brutal: $500/violation standard, $1,500 if willful. A 10,000-contact campaign with consent gaps = $5M+ exposure.

Businesses that respond before a lawsuit is filed typically settle at 10-20% of post-filing amounts.

Cease & Desist Response Hub
terms.law/Demand-Letters/respond/cease-and-desist/

8 defense guides + 2 interactive tools:

- IP Threat Letters — trademark, copyright, DMCA, patent defense
- Online Defamation — CRFA, Anti-SLAPP, Section 230 analysis
- Patent Demand Letters — PAE defense and 35+ state anti-troll statutes
- Trade Secrets & NDAs — DTSA, CUTSA, California B&P 16600
- Anti-SLAPP Analysis — Flatley v. Mauro and the extortion line
- Abusive C&D Tactics — 8 bad-faith indicators

Interactive tools:
- C&D Response Generator — customized letters for 8 threat types
- Triage Assessment — risk rating and recommended next steps

Not every C&D deserves the same response. Some require immediate compliance. Others are pure intimidation.

Both hubs are free. Built from the playbooks I use in pre-litigation practice.
