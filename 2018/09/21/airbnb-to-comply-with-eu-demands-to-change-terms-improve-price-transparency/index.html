<p>On September 20, 2018 the European Commission has issued a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-5809_en.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> stating that Airbnb has committed to complying with the EU consumer authorities&#8217; demands presented to the company in July. </p>
<p>Specifically, Airbnb has agreed by the end of 2018 to make changes to their terms and conditions and improve price transparency by:</p>
<p>&#8211; presenting the total price of bookings, including extra fees, such as service and cleaning charges. When it is not possible to calculate the final price in advance, they have committed to clearly informing the consumer that additional fees might apply.</p>
<p>&#8211; clearly identifying whether an offer is made by a private host or by a professional, as the consumer protection rules differ for each.</p>
<p>&#8211;  making it clear that consumers can use all the legal remedies available and in particular their right to sue a host in case of personal harm or other damages. The proceedings can be brought against Airbnb before the courts of user&#8217;s country of residence.<br />   <br />&#8211; informing consumers when the company decides to terminate a contract or remove content and will offer to consumers the right to appeal and to compensation if appropriate.</p>
