# NDA Risk Analyzer - Redlining Fix

## Problem Fixed
The "Download Redlined Version" feature was previously generating RTF files with complex markup that displayed as plain text instead of proper redlined documents in Microsoft Word.

## Solution Implemented
Replaced complex RTF generation with a simpler, more reliable HTML-to-Word conversion approach:

### Key Changes:
1. **HTML-to-Word Conversion**: Using HTML with inline CSS styles instead of RTF markup
2. **Simplified Redlining**: Clear strikethrough (red) for deletions, green highlighting for insertions
3. **Better Compatibility**: Works reliably with Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and other word processors

### Technical Details:
- **Deleted text**: `<span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: red;">text</span>`
- **Inserted text**: `<span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black;">text</span>`
- **File format**: HTML saved with `.doc` extension for automatic Word opening
- **Styling**: Professional document formatting with proper margins, fonts, and spacing

## Testing the Fix

### Method 1: Console Testing
1. Open the NDA Risk Analyzer in your browser
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Run: `testHTMLToWord()` - Downloads a test redlined document
4. Run: `validateRedlineGeneration()` - Validates redline logic

### Method 2: Full Workflow Testing
1. Upload/paste an NDA into the analyzer
2. Click "Analyze NDA" 
3. Select some improvements from the suggestions
4. Click "Redlined Word" button
5. Open the downloaded file in Microsoft Word
6. Verify proper redlining is displayed

- **Strikethrough text in red**: Original text being replaced
