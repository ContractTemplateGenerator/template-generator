## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Standard Provisions Analysis Matrix

Analyzes 8 key NDA provisions:

| Provision | Analysis | Party Impact |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Definition of Confidential Information** | Narrow/Standard/Broad | Who benefits from broad vs narrow definitions |
| **Term Duration** | Short/Standard/Long | Impact of 1-2 years vs 5+ years vs perpetual |
| **Purpose Limitation** | Strict/Standard/Broad | How usage restrictions affect each party |
| **Disclosure Obligations** | Mutual/One-way/Unbalanced | Which party must disclose what |
| **Return/Destruction** | Strict/Standard/Lenient | Burden on receiving party |
| **Remedies for Breach** | Limited/Standard/Harsh | Available remedies and their impact |
| **Governing Law & Jurisdiction** | Neutral/Party1/Party2 | Which party's preferred courts/laws |
| **Survival Clauses** | Limited/Standard/Extensive | What survives agreement termination |

- 🔒 Make it favor Disclosing Party

## 🔌 API Integration

**Uses Existing API Pattern:**

fetch('/api/nda-risk-chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        messages: [{
            role: 'user',
            content: analysisPrompt
        }]
    })
