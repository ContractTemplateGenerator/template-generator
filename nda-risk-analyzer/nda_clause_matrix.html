        <ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
            <li><strong>Dependency Mapping:</strong> Some clauses are foundational (like confidential info definition) and affect the interpretation of all others.</li>
            <li><strong>Context Sensitivity:</strong> Industry, transaction type, and party relationship significantly affect which provisions are standard vs. unusual.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance Indicators:</strong> Look for patterns - if multiple provisions favor one party, the agreement is likely unbalanced.</li>
            <li><strong>Enforceability Flags:</strong> Missing exclusions + broad definitions often create unenforceable overreach.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Cascading:</strong> High-risk missing provisions can make other protective provisions meaningless.</li>
