I intend to file an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association on or after July 23, 2025 unless this matter is resolved before that date.\n\nI am writing regarding Stripe's continued withholding of $[AMOUNT] in customer payments belonging to [COMPANY NAME]. Despite the passage of significant time since the fund hold began, your company continues to hold these funds without providing any reasonable timeline for release.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis account has no history of policy violations or compliance issues. Stripe initiated a hold on my merchant funds, citing vague \"risk\" concerns without identifying any specific violations of your Services Agreement or providing clear justification for the withholding. \n\n[COMPANY NAME] operated as a [BUSINESS TYPE] business for [PROCESSING HISTORY] with Stripe, maintaining a clean processing history throughout our relationship.\n\nSince the fund hold began, Stripe has failed to:\n- Provide specific justification for the continued withholding beyond general references to \"risk\"\n- Establish any concrete timeline for releasing the held funds\n- Identify any specific Service Agreement violations that would justify indefinite withholding\n\n\nLEGAL CLAIMS\n\nStripe's actions constitute multiple breaches of the SSA, including but not limited to:\n\n1. BREACH OF CONTRACT: Stripe has materially breached the SSA by withholding funds for an unreasonable period without contractual authority and by failing to process promised payment releases within stated timeframes.\n\n2. CONVERSION: Stripe has wrongfully exercised dominion over $[AMOUNT] belonging to [COMPANY NAME], depriving us of our rightful property beyond any reasonable period necessary for risk management.\n\n3. BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING: Even where the SSA grants Stripe discretion, it must be exercised in good faith. Stripe's arbitrary withholding of funds without substantial justification violates this fundamental contractual obligation.\n\n4. VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS & PROFESSIONS CODE § 17200: Stripe's systematic withholding of merchant funds without clear contractual authority constitutes an unfair business practice under California law, allowing for restitution of profits earned on improperly withheld funds.\n\nSUPPORTING EVIDENCE\n\nWe have documented evidence supporting our position, including our clean processing history and Stripe's failure to provide specific justification for the continued hold.\n\nDEMAND FOR RESOLUTION\n\nTo resolve this matter without proceeding to arbitration, I demand the following:\n\n1. Immediate release of the $[AMOUNT] in withheld funds\n2. Accounting of any interest earned on these funds while held by Stripe\n3. Written confirmation of the release timeline\n\nIf I do not receive a satisfactory response by July 7, 2025, I intend to file an arbitration demand upon the expiration of the 30-day notice period required by Section 13.3(a) of the SSA.\n\n\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[CONTACT NAME]\n[COMPANY NAME]","content_type":"text"},"signers":[{"email":"sergei.tokmakov@gmail.com","name":"Sergei Tokmakov","role":"signer"}]}

I intend to file an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association on or after July 23, 2025 unless this matter is resolved before that date.\n\nI am writing regarding Stripe's continued withholding of $[AMOUNT] in customer payments belonging to [COMPANY NAME]. Despite the passage of significant time since the fund hold began, your company continues to hold these funds without providing any reasonable timeline for release.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis account has no history of policy violations or compliance issues. Stripe initiated a hold on my merchant funds, citing vague \"risk\" concerns without identifying any specific violations of your Services Agreement or providing clear justification for the withholding. \n\n[COMPANY NAME] operated as a [BUSINESS TYPE] business for [PROCESSING HISTORY] with Stripe, maintaining a clean processing history throughout our relationship.\n\nSince the fund hold began, Stripe has failed to:\n- Provide specific justification for the continued withholding beyond general references to \"risk\"\n- Establish any concrete timeline for releasing the held funds\n- Identify any specific Service Agreement violations that would justify indefinite withholding\n\n\nLEGAL CLAIMS\n\nStripe's actions constitute multiple breaches of the SSA, including but not limited to:\n\n1. BREACH OF CONTRACT: Stripe has materially breached the SSA by withholding funds for an unreasonable period without contractual authority and by failing to process promised payment releases within stated timeframes.\n\n2. CONVERSION: Stripe has wrongfully exercised dominion over $[AMOUNT] belonging to [COMPANY NAME], depriving us of our rightful property beyond any reasonable period necessary for risk management.\n\n3. BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING: Even where the SSA grants Stripe discretion, it must be exercised in good faith. Stripe's arbitrary withholding of funds without substantial justification violates this fundamental contractual obligation.\n\n4. VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS & PROFESSIONS CODE § 17200: Stripe's systematic withholding of merchant funds without clear contractual authority constitutes an unfair business practice under California law, allowing for restitution of profits earned on improperly withheld funds.\n\nSUPPORTING EVIDENCE\n\nWe have documented evidence supporting our position, including our clean processing history and Stripe's failure to provide specific justification for the continued hold.\n\nDEMAND FOR RESOLUTION\n\nTo resolve this matter without proceeding to arbitration, I demand the following:\n\n1. Immediate release of the $[AMOUNT] in withheld funds\n2. Accounting of any interest earned on these funds while held by Stripe\n3. Written confirmation of the release timeline\n\nIf I do not receive a satisfactory response by July 7, 2025, I intend to file an arbitration demand upon the expiration of the 30-day notice period required by Section 13.3(a) of the SSA.\n\n\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[CONTACT NAME]\n[COMPANY NAME]","content_type":"text"},"signers":[{"email":"sergei.tokmakov@gmail.com","name":"Sergei Tokmakov","role":"signer"}]}

I intend to file an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association on or after July 23, 2025 unless this matter is resolved before that date.\n\nI am writing regarding Stripe's continued withholding of $[AMOUNT] in customer payments belonging to [COMPANY NAME]. Despite the passage of significant time since the fund hold began, your company continues to hold these funds without providing any reasonable timeline for release.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis account has no history of policy violations or compliance issues. Stripe initiated a hold on my merchant funds, citing vague \"risk\" concerns without identifying any specific violations of your Services Agreement or providing clear justification for the withholding. \n\n[COMPANY NAME] operated as a [BUSINESS TYPE] business for [PROCESSING HISTORY] with Stripe, maintaining a clean processing history throughout our relationship.\n\nSince the fund hold began, Stripe has failed to:\n- Provide specific justification for the continued withholding beyond general references to \"risk\"\n- Establish any concrete timeline for releasing the held funds\n- Identify any specific Service Agreement violations that would justify indefinite withholding\n\n\nLEGAL CLAIMS\n\nStripe's actions constitute multiple breaches of the SSA, including but not limited to:\n\n1. BREACH OF CONTRACT: Stripe has materially breached the SSA by withholding funds for an unreasonable period without contractual authority and by failing to process promised payment releases within stated timeframes.\n\n2. CONVERSION: Stripe has wrongfully exercised dominion over $[AMOUNT] belonging to [COMPANY NAME], depriving us of our rightful property beyond any reasonable period necessary for risk management.\n\n3. BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING: Even where the SSA grants Stripe discretion, it must be exercised in good faith. Stripe's arbitrary withholding of funds without substantial justification violates this fundamental contractual obligation.\n\n4. VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS & PROFESSIONS CODE § 17200: Stripe's systematic withholding of merchant funds without clear contractual authority constitutes an unfair business practice under California law, allowing for restitution of profits earned on improperly withheld funds.\n\nSUPPORTING EVIDENCE\n\nWe have documented evidence supporting our position, including our clean processing history and Stripe's failure to provide specific justification for the continued hold.\n\nDEMAND FOR RESOLUTION\n\nTo resolve this matter without proceeding to arbitration, I demand the following:\n\n1. Immediate release of the $[AMOUNT] in withheld funds\n2. Accounting of any interest earned on these funds while held by Stripe\n3. Written confirmation of the release timeline\n\nIf I do not receive a satisfactory response by July 7, 2025, I intend to file an arbitration demand upon the expiration of the 30-day notice period required by Section 13.3(a) of the SSA.\n\n\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n[COMPANY NAME]"

Raw request body: {"test":"yes","template":{"title":"Stripe Demand Letter with Arbitration - HGFHGFD","content":"HGFHGFD\nGDFHGFD\n[CITY], CA [ZIP]\nHGFDHGFD\nHGFDHGF\n\nJune 23, 2025\n\nVIA CERTIFIED MAIL & EMAIL\ncomplaints@stripe.com\n\nLegal Department\nStripe, Inc.\n354 Oyster Point Boulevard\nSouth San Francisco, CA 94080\n\nRe: HGFHGFD - Demand for Release of Withheld Funds\n    Account ID: [ACCOUNT ID]\n    Amount at Issue: $[AMOUNT]\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nThis letter serves as formal notice pursuant to Section 13.3(a) of the Stripe Services Agreement (\"SSA\") of my intent to commence arbitration proceedings against Stripe, Inc. and Stripe Payments Company. I intend to file an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association on or after July 23, 2025 unless this matter is resolved before that date.\n\nI am writing regarding Stripe's continued withholding of $[AMOUNT] in customer payments belonging to HGFHGFD. Despite the passage of significant time since the fund hold began, your company continues to hold these funds without providing any reasonable timeline for release.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis account has no history of policy violations or compliance issues. Stripe initiated a hold on my merchant funds, citing vague \"risk\" concerns without identifying any specific violations of your Services Agreement or providing clear justification for the withholding. \n\nHGFHGFD operated as a [BUSINESS TYPE] business for [PROCESSING HISTORY] with Stripe, maintaining a clean processing history throughout our relationship.\n\nSince the fund hold began, Stripe has failed to:\n- Provide specific justification for the continued withholding beyond general references to \"risk\"\n- Establish any concrete timeline for releasing the held funds\n- Identify any specific Service Agreement violations that would justify indefinite withholding\n\n\nLEGAL CLAIMS\n\nStripe's actions constitute multiple breaches of the SSA, including but not limited to:\n\n1. BREACH OF CONTRACT: Stripe has materially breached the SSA by withholding funds for an unreasonable period without contractual authority and by failing to process promised payment releases within stated timeframes.\n\n2. CONVERSION: Stripe has wrongfully exercised dominion over $[AMOUNT] belonging to HGFHGFD, depriving us of our rightful property beyond any reasonable period necessary for risk management.\n\n3. BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING: Even where the SSA grants Stripe discretion, it must be exercised in good faith. Stripe's arbitrary withholding of funds without substantial justification violates this fundamental contractual obligation.\n\n4. VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS & PROFESSIONS CODE § 17200: Stripe's systematic withholding of merchant funds without clear contractual authority constitutes an unfair business practice under California law, allowing for restitution of profits earned on improperly withheld funds.\n\nSUPPORTING EVIDENCE\n\nWe have documented evidence supporting our position, including our clean processing history and Stripe's failure to provide specific justification for the continued hold.\n\nDEMAND FOR RESOLUTION\n\nTo resolve this matter without proceeding to arbitration, I demand the following:\n\n1. Immediate release of the $[AMOUNT] in withheld funds\n2. Accounting of any interest earned on these funds while held by Stripe\n3. Written confirmation of the release timeline\n\nIf I do not receive a satisfactory response by July 7, 2025, I intend to file an arbitration demand upon the expiration of the 30-day notice period required by Section 13.3(a) of the SSA.\n\nAttached hereto as Exhibit A is a draft arbitration demand that will be filed with the American Arbitration Association if this matter is not resolved within the specified timeframe. This attachment demonstrates the seriousness of this matter and my preparedness to pursue all available legal remedies.\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGFDHGFD\nHGFHGFD\n\n================================================================================\nARBITRATION DEMAND (ATTACHMENT)\n================================================================================\n\nAMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION\nSAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA\n\nDEMAND FOR ARBITRATION\n\nHGFHGFD                                          AAA Case No. ___________\n               Claimant\n\nv.\n\nStripe, Inc.\n               Respondent\n_______________________________\n\nTO THE HONORABLE ARBITRATOR:\n\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n1. This matter is subject to arbitration pursuant to Section 13 of the Stripe Services Agreement, which provides that disputes \"must be resolved by individual binding arbitration\" and shall be \"conducted by the American Arbitration Association under its [Commercial Arbitration] rules and procedures.\" The SSA further provides that all disputes \"will be determined by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California before a single arbitrator.\"\n\n2. This dispute arises from Respondent's systematic breach of the Stripe Services Agreement (\"SSA\") and wrongful withholding of $[AMOUNT] in customer payments belonging to Claimant.  \n\n3. This case involves a pattern of conduct where Stripe terminates merchant accounts and indefinitely withholds funds using vague \"risk\" justifications that lack specificity and contractual basis.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n4. This account has no history of policy violations or compliance issues. Respondent initiated an indefinite hold on Claimant's merchant funds, citing vague \"risk\" concerns without identifying any specific violations of the Services Agreement or providing clear justification for the withholding. \n\n5. Prior to this action, Claimant operated as a [BUSINESS TYPE] business for [PROCESSING HISTORY] with Stripe, maintaining a clean processing history throughout the relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAUSES OF ACTION\n\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Breach of Contract)\n\n9. Claimant and Respondent entered into the Stripe Services Agreement, whereby Respondent agreed to process payment transactions and release funds according to specified terms and timelines. The SSA does not grant Respondent unlimited discretion to withhold merchant funds indefinitely based on subjective \"risk\" assessments.\n\n10. Respondent has materially breached the SSA by:\na) Withholding funds for an unreasonable period without contractual authority;\nb) Failing to provide specific justification for fund withholding as required by good faith performance;\nc) Continuously extending promised release dates without reasonable justification;\nd) Applying retroactive \"risk\" designations to previously approved business models;\ne) Exercising discretionary powers in bad faith and without reasonable basis.\n\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Conversion)\n\n11. The withheld funds of $[AMOUNT] were the property of Claimant, representing customer payments for goods and services already provided. Respondent has wrongfully exercised dominion over these funds beyond any reasonable period necessary for legitimate risk management.\n\n12. Conversion is established by Respondent's intentional exercise of dominion or control over Claimant's property in a manner inconsistent with Claimant's rights. Respondent's indefinite withholding without clear resolution criteria constitutes intentional deprivation of Claimant's property.\n\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing)\n\n13. Every contract contains an implied covenant that neither party will act to frustrate the other party's right to receive the benefits of the agreement. Respondent has violated this covenant by:\n\na) Exercising its discretionary powers under the SSA arbitrarily and capriciously;\nb) Applying subjective \"risk\" criteria without providing objective standards or evidence;\nc) Creating shifting and unreasonable timelines for fund release;\nd) Withholding funds based on vague and unsubstantiated concerns;\ne) Failing to act reasonably in the exercise of contractual discretion.\n\nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Violation of California Business & Professions Code § 17200)\n\n14. California's Unfair Competition Law prohibits unfair, unlawful, or fraudulent business practices. Respondent's systematic withholding of merchant funds without clear contractual authority constitutes an unfair business practice that:\n\na) Violates public policy favoring prompt payment of earned compensation;\nb) Creates an imbalance in contractual relationships through arbitrary exercise of power;\nc) Damages competition by forcing merchants to seek alternative payment processors;\nd) Unjustly enriches Respondent through interest earned on improperly withheld funds;\ne) Lacks reasonable business justification proportionate to claimed risks.\n\n\n\nRELIEF SOUGHT\n\nWHEREFORE, Claimant respectfully requests that this Tribunal:\n\nA. Award damages for breach of contract in an amount to be proven at hearing, but not less than $[AMOUNT];\nB. Award damages for conversion in an amount to be proven at hearing;\nC. Order immediate release of all withheld funds;\nD. Award restitution of any interest or profits earned on withheld funds;\nE. Award reasonable attorney fees and costs of this arbitration pursuant to SSA Section 13.3(d);\nF. Award such other relief as the Tribunal deems just and proper.\n\n\nGFDHGFD\nHGFHGFD\nClaimant\n\nDated: _________________","content_type":"text"},"signers":[{"email":"sergei.tokmakov@gmail.com","name":"Sergei Tokmakov","role":"signer"}]}

I intend to file an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association on or after July 23, 2025 unless this matter is resolved before that date.\n\nI am writing regarding Stripe's continued withholding of $[AMOUNT] in customer payments belonging to HGFHGFD. Despite the passage of significant time since the fund hold began, your company continues to hold these funds without providing any reasonable timeline for release.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis account has no history of policy violations or compliance issues. Stripe initiated a hold on my merchant funds, citing vague \"risk\" concerns without identifying any specific violations of your Services Agreement or providing clear justification for the withholding. \n\nHGFHGFD operated as a [BUSINESS TYPE] business for [PROCESSING HISTORY] with Stripe, maintaining a clean processing history throughout our relationship.\n\nSince the fund hold began, Stripe has failed to:\n- Provide specific justification for the continued withholding beyond general references to \"risk\"\n- Establish any concrete timeline for releasing the held funds\n- Identify any specific Service Agreement violations that would justify indefinite withholding\n\n\nLEGAL CLAIMS\n\nStripe's actions constitute multiple breaches of the SSA, including but not limited to:\n\n1. BREACH OF CONTRACT: Stripe has materially breached the SSA by withholding funds for an unreasonable period without contractual authority and by failing to process promised payment releases within stated timeframes.\n\n2. CONVERSION: Stripe has wrongfully exercised dominion over $[AMOUNT] belonging to HGFHGFD, depriving us of our rightful property beyond any reasonable period necessary for risk management.\n\n3. BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING: Even where the SSA grants Stripe discretion, it must be exercised in good faith. Stripe's arbitrary withholding of funds without substantial justification violates this fundamental contractual obligation.\n\n4. VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS & PROFESSIONS CODE § 17200: Stripe's systematic withholding of merchant funds without clear contractual authority constitutes an unfair business practice under California law, allowing for restitution of profits earned on improperly withheld funds.\n\nSUPPORTING EVIDENCE\n\nWe have documented evidence supporting our position, including our clean processing history and Stripe's failure to provide specific justification for the continued hold.\n\nDEMAND FOR RESOLUTION\n\nTo resolve this matter without proceeding to arbitration, I demand the following:\n\n1. Immediate release of the $[AMOUNT] in withheld funds\n2. Accounting of any interest earned on these funds while held by Stripe\n3. Written confirmation of the release timeline\n\nIf I do not receive a satisfactory response by July 7, 2025, I intend to file an arbitration demand upon the expiration of the 30-day notice period required by Section 13.3(a) of the SSA.\n\nAttached hereto as Exhibit A is a draft arbitration demand that will be filed with the American Arbitration Association if this matter is not resolved within the specified timeframe. This attachment demonstrates the seriousness of this matter and my preparedness to pursue all available legal remedies.\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGFDHGFD\nHGFHGFD\n\n================================================================================\nARBITRATION DEMAND (ATTACHMENT)\n================================================================================\n\nAMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION\nSAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA\n\nDEMAND FOR ARBITRATION\n\nHGFHGFD                                          AAA Case No. ___________\n               Claimant\n\nv.\n\nStripe, Inc.\n               Respondent\n_______________________________\n\nTO THE HONORABLE ARBITRATOR:\n\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n1. This matter is subject to arbitration pursuant to Section 13 of the Stripe Services Agreement, which provides that disputes \"must be resolved by individual binding arbitration\" and shall be \"conducted by the American Arbitration Association under its [Commercial Arbitration] rules and procedures.\" The SSA further provides that all disputes \"will be determined by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California before a single arbitrator.\"\n\n2. This dispute arises from Respondent's systematic breach of the Stripe Services Agreement (\"SSA\") and wrongful withholding of $[AMOUNT] in customer payments belonging to Claimant.  \n\n3. This case involves a pattern of conduct where Stripe terminates merchant accounts and indefinitely withholds funds using vague \"risk\" justifications that lack specificity and contractual basis.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n4. This account has no history of policy violations or compliance issues. Respondent initiated an indefinite hold on Claimant's merchant funds, citing vague \"risk\" concerns without identifying any specific violations of the Services Agreement or providing clear justification for the withholding. \n\n5. Prior to this action, Claimant operated as a [BUSINESS TYPE] business for [PROCESSING HISTORY] with Stripe, maintaining a clean processing history throughout the relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAUSES OF ACTION\n\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Breach of Contract)\n\n9. Claimant and Respondent entered into the Stripe Services Agreement, whereby Respondent agreed to process payment transactions and release funds according to specified terms and timelines. The SSA does not grant Respondent unlimited discretion to withhold merchant funds indefinitely based on subjective \"risk\" assessments.\n\n10. Respondent has materially breached the SSA by:\na) Withholding funds for an unreasonable period without contractual authority;\nb) Failing to provide specific justification for fund withholding as required by good faith performance;\nc) Continuously extending promised release dates without reasonable justification;\nd) Applying retroactive \"risk\" designations to previously approved business models;\ne) Exercising discretionary powers in bad faith and without reasonable basis.\n\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Conversion)\n\n11. The withheld funds of $[AMOUNT] were the property of Claimant, representing customer payments for goods and services already provided. Respondent has wrongfully exercised dominion over these funds beyond any reasonable period necessary for legitimate risk management.\n\n12. Conversion is established by Respondent's intentional exercise of dominion or control over Claimant's property in a manner inconsistent with Claimant's rights. Respondent's indefinite withholding without clear resolution criteria constitutes intentional deprivation of Claimant's property.\n\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing)\n\n13. Every contract contains an implied covenant that neither party will act to frustrate the other party's right to receive the benefits of the agreement. Respondent has violated this covenant by:\n\na) Exercising its discretionary powers under the SSA arbitrarily and capriciously;\nb) Applying subjective \"risk\" criteria without providing objective standards or evidence;\nc) Creating shifting and unreasonable timelines for fund release;\nd) Withholding funds based on vague and unsubstantiated concerns;\ne) Failing to act reasonably in the exercise of contractual discretion.\n\nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Violation of California Business & Professions Code § 17200)\n\n14. California's Unfair Competition Law prohibits unfair, unlawful, or fraudulent business practices. Respondent's systematic withholding of merchant funds without clear contractual authority constitutes an unfair business practice that:\n\na) Violates public policy favoring prompt payment of earned compensation;\nb) Creates an imbalance in contractual relationships through arbitrary exercise of power;\nc) Damages competition by forcing merchants to seek alternative payment processors;\nd) Unjustly enriches Respondent through interest earned on improperly withheld funds;\ne) Lacks reasonable business justification proportionate to claimed risks.\n\n\n\nRELIEF SOUGHT\n\nWHEREFORE, Claimant respectfully requests that this Tribunal:\n\nA. Award damages for breach of contract in an amount to be proven at hearing, but not less than $[AMOUNT];\nB. Award damages for conversion in an amount to be proven at hearing;\nC. Order immediate release of all withheld funds;\nD. Award restitution of any interest or profits earned on withheld funds;\nE. Award reasonable attorney fees and costs of this arbitration pursuant to SSA Section 13.3(d);\nF. Award such other relief as the Tribunal deems just and proper.\n\n\nGFDHGFD\nHGFHGFD\nClaimant\n\nDated: _________________"
