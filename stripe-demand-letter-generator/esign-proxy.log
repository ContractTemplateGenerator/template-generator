I intend to file an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association on or after July 23, 2025 unless this matter is resolved before that date.\n\nI am writing regarding Stripe's continued withholding of $[AMOUNT] in customer payments belonging to [COMPANY NAME]. Despite the passage of significant time since the fund hold began, your company continues to hold these funds without providing any reasonable timeline for release.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis account has no history of policy violations or compliance issues. Stripe initiated a hold on my merchant funds, citing vague \"risk\" concerns without identifying any specific violations of your Services Agreement or providing clear justification for the withholding. \n\n[COMPANY NAME] operated as a [BUSINESS TYPE] business for [PROCESSING HISTORY] with Stripe, maintaining a clean processing history throughout our relationship.\n\nSince the fund hold began, Stripe has failed to:\n- Provide specific justification for the continued withholding beyond general references to \"risk\"\n- Establish any concrete timeline for releasing the held funds\n- Identify any specific Service Agreement violations that would justify indefinite withholding\n\n\nLEGAL CLAIMS\n\nStripe's actions constitute multiple breaches of the SSA, including but not limited to:\n\n1. BREACH OF CONTRACT: Stripe has materially breached the SSA by withholding funds for an unreasonable period without contractual authority and by failing to process promised payment releases within stated timeframes.\n\n2. CONVERSION: Stripe has wrongfully exercised dominion over $[AMOUNT] belonging to [COMPANY NAME], depriving us of our rightful property beyond any reasonable period necessary for risk management.\n\n3. BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING: Even where the SSA grants Stripe discretion, it must be exercised in good faith. Stripe's arbitrary withholding of funds without substantial justification violates this fundamental contractual obligation.\n\n4. VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS & PROFESSIONS CODE § 17200: Stripe's systematic withholding of merchant funds without clear contractual authority constitutes an unfair business practice under California law, allowing for restitution of profits earned on improperly withheld funds.\n\nSUPPORTING EVIDENCE\n\nWe have documented evidence supporting our position, including our clean processing history and Stripe's failure to provide specific justification for the continued hold.\n\nDEMAND FOR RESOLUTION\n\nTo resolve this matter without proceeding to arbitration, I demand the following:\n\n1. Immediate release of the $[AMOUNT] in withheld funds\n2. Accounting of any interest earned on these funds while held by Stripe\n3. Written confirmation of the release timeline\n\nIf I do not receive a satisfactory response by July 7, 2025, I intend to file an arbitration demand upon the expiration of the 30-day notice period required by Section 13.3(a) of the SSA.\n\n\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[CONTACT NAME]\n","content_type":"text"},"signers":[{"email":"sergei.tokmakov@gmail.com","name":"Sergei Tokmakov","role":"signer"}]}

Raw request body: {"test":"yes","template":{"title":"Stripe Demand Letter - Company","content":"[COMPANY NAME]\n[ADDRESS]\n[CITY], CA [ZIP]\n[PHONE]\n[EMAIL]\n\nJune 23, 2025\n\nVIA CERTIFIED MAIL & EMAIL\ncomplaints@stripe.com\n\nLegal Department\nStripe, Inc.\n354 Oyster Point Boulevard\nSouth San Francisco, CA 94080\n\nRe: [COMPANY NAME] - Demand for Release of Withheld Funds\n    Account ID: [ACCOUNT ID]\n    Amount at Issue: $[AMOUNT]\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nThis letter serves as formal notice pursuant to Section 13.3(a) of the Stripe Services Agreement (\"SSA\") of my intent to commence arbitration proceedings against Stripe, Inc. and Stripe Payments Company. I intend to file an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association on or after July 23, 2025 unless this matter is resolved before that date.\n\nI am writing regarding Stripe's continued withholding of $[AMOUNT] in customer payments belonging to [COMPANY NAME]. Despite the passage of significant time since the fund hold began, your company continues to hold these funds without providing any reasonable timeline for release.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis account has no history of policy violations or compliance issues.

Raw request body: {"test":"yes","template":{"title":"Stripe Demand Letter - Company","content":"[COMPANY NAME]\n[ADDRESS]\n[CITY], CA [ZIP]\n[PHONE]\n[EMAIL]\n\nJune 23, 2025\n\nVIA CERTIFIED MAIL & EMAIL\ncomplaints@stripe.com\n\nLegal Department\nStripe, Inc.\n354 Oyster Point Boulevard\nSouth San Francisco, CA 94080\n\nRe: [COMPANY NAME] - Demand for Release of Withheld Funds\n    Account ID: [ACCOUNT ID]\n    Amount at Issue: $[AMOUNT]\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nThis letter serves as formal notice pursuant to Section 13.3(a) of the Stripe Services Agreement (\"SSA\") of my intent to commence arbitration proceedings against Stripe, Inc. and Stripe Payments Company. I intend to file an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association on or after July 23, 2025 unless this matter is resolved before that date.\n\nI am writing regarding Stripe's continued withholding of $[AMOUNT] in customer payments belonging to [COMPANY NAME]. Despite the passage of significant time since the fund hold began, your company continues to hold these funds without providing any reasonable timeline for release.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis account has no history of policy violations or compliance issues. Stripe initiated a hold on my merchant funds, citing vague \"risk\" concerns without identifying any specific violations of your Services Agreement or providing clear justification for the withholding. \n\n[COMPANY NAME] operated as a [BUSINESS TYPE] business for [PROCESSING HISTORY] with Stripe, maintaining a clean processing history throughout our relationship.\n\nSince the fund hold began, Stripe has failed to:\n- Provide specific justification for the continued withholding beyond general references to \"risk\"\n- Establish any concrete timeline for releasing the held funds\n- Identify any specific Service Agreement violations that would justify indefinite withholding\n\n\nLEGAL CLAIMS\n\nStripe's actions constitute multiple breaches of the SSA, including but not limited to:\n\n1. BREACH OF CONTRACT: Stripe has materially breached the SSA by withholding funds for an unreasonable period without contractual authority and by failing to process promised payment releases within stated timeframes.\n\n2. CONVERSION: Stripe has wrongfully exercised dominion over $[AMOUNT] belonging to [COMPANY NAME], depriving us of our rightful property beyond any reasonable period necessary for risk management.\n\n3. BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING: Even where the SSA grants Stripe discretion, it must be exercised in good faith. Stripe's arbitrary withholding of funds without substantial justification violates this fundamental contractual obligation.\n\n4. VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS & PROFESSIONS CODE § 17200: Stripe's systematic withholding of merchant funds without clear contractual authority constitutes an unfair business practice under California law, allowing for restitution of profits earned on improperly withheld funds.\n\nSUPPORTING EVIDENCE\n\nWe have documented evidence supporting our position, including our clean processing history and Stripe's failure to provide specific justification for the continued hold.\n\nDEMAND FOR RESOLUTION\n\nTo resolve this matter without proceeding to arbitration, I demand the following:\n\n1. Immediate release of the $[AMOUNT] in withheld funds\n2. Accounting of any interest earned on these funds while held by Stripe\n3. Written confirmation of the release timeline\n\nIf I do not receive a satisfactory response by July 7, 2025, I intend to file an arbitration demand upon the expiration of the 30-day notice period required by Section 13.3(a) of the SSA.\n\n\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[CONTACT NAME]\n","content_type":"text"},"signers":[{"email":"sergei.tokmakov@gmail.com","name":"Sergei Tokmakov","role":"signer"}]}
