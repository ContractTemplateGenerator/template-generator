<div class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">A </span><b style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">foreign rights agreement </b><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">is a contract to that allows a publisher to translate&nbsp;and publish a book within a certain territory. These contracts are beneficial for authors who would otherwise have difficulty penetrating the markets in those territories by themselves. Selling foreign rights allows an author to profit multiple times from the same work. In fact, in some countries, foreign rights can be sold for more money than what the original book generates in the author’s home country. That’s why a smart contract strategy for an author would be to execute several contracts with different publishers, each of which is best positioned to promote and distribute the book in a certain language within a specific territory.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;"><span>Authors should be particularly careful not to accidentally give away foreign rights to publishers who don’t publish much in foreign countries. E.g., what typically happens is that a publisher offers a new author a publishing contract where subsidiary rights (such as foreign rights) are licensed to a publisher that doesn’t have a capacity to exercise them to author’s full advantage. E.g., it’s a publisher that only publishes English language books that it markets only in the United States.&nbsp;No foreign distribution system. Authors should take care not to convey rights to publishers who have no intention or capacity to exercise those rights. </span></div>
